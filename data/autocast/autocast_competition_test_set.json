    "background": "President Biden and Democrats in Congress are exploring policy options to impose mandatory carbon pricing in the United States (Harvard Environmental &amp; Energy Law Program, The Hill, European Parliament). For the purposes of this question, a carbon pricing mechanism would be a legal framework that captures the external costs of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and ties them to their sources through a price, usually in the form of a price on the CO2 emitted, and could include taxes and/or a cap-and-trade system (World Bank). Examples of existing mandatory carbon pricing mechanisms include the EU Emissions Trading System (European Commission), the California Cap-and-Trade Program (California Air Resources Board), and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).",

According to the Axios Harris Poll's recently released 2021 Corporate Reputation Rankings, the reputation of big tech companies has taken a \"pandemic plunge.\" Among the Big 5 tech companies -- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft -- Amazon remains at the top at #10 (out of 100), and Facebook remains at the bottom at #98 (out of 100). Between those two extremes, Microsoft and Google's rankings dropped significantly since 2020. Only Apple's ranking improved between 2020 and 2021, from #27 to #16 (out of 100).Data and resolution details. This question resolves based on the results of the 2022 Axios Harris Poll. Based on the publication schedule of previous polls, we expect the 2022 poll to be released between February and July 2022.The Axios Harris poll describes its methodology as follows: \"The Axios Harris Poll 100 is based on a survey of 42,935 Americans in a nationally representative sample. The two-step process starts fresh each year by surveying the public’s top-of-mind awareness of companies that either excel or falter in society. These 100 'most visible companies' are then rated by a second group of Americans across the seven key dimensions of reputation to determine the ranking. If a company is not on the list, it did not reach a critical level of visibility to be measured.\"Note on reading the graph: The x-axis is the average company ranking out of 100. That means a higher number = a worse reputation.  The data underlying the graph is here.This question was proposed by Foretell pro forecaster Anthony Cordetti (username: ACordetti).To suggest a change or clarification to this question, please select Request Clarification from the green gear-shaped dropdown button to the right of the question.",

    "question": "[Experimental] What will be the consensus crowd forecast on October 1, 2021, on whether COVID-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan, China?",
    "id": "C155",
    "background": "Note on this question. This question is part of a pair of experimental questions. Its sister question&nbsp;asks about forecasters' genuine beliefs about the origin of COVID-19. That question will not be scored. Its purpose is to serve as a ground truth to be forecasted in this question. The sister question will be scored. Its purpose is to elicit forecasts about the crowd consensus for the sister question on October 1, 2021. We recognize that the pair of questions can be gamed by providing disingenuous forecasts on the sister question to improve one's score on this question. We kindly ask that forecasters not do that.&nbsp;Related question.&nbsp;Related questions are on Metaculus&nbsp;and Hypermind.Context. The leading hypotheses for the origin of COVID-19 are (i) animal-to-human transmission, and (ii) a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (\"lab-leak theory\"). Two Chinese researchers stated in a paper in February 2020 that the virus likely originated in a lab in Wuhan, China. The lab-leak theory also had champions within conservative circles in the United States. The World Health Organization dismissed the lab-leak theory, however, and -- as reported by the New York Times -- the apparent politicization of the theory in the U.S. created a \"fake bubble of consensus\" among scientists and the media against the theory (quoting Matthew Yglesias).The lab-leak theory is now receiving renewed attention. On May 14, 2021,18 scientists stated in a letter to the Journal of Science that the lab-leak theory is \"viable.\" Other scientists have recently come out as less dismissive of the lab-leak theory. And on May 27, President Biden asked the U.S. intelligence community to investigate the lab-leak theory and report back to him in 90 days. (See also Washington Post timeline on how the lab-leak theory became credible.)Resolution details. This question will resolve based on the consensus crowd forecast of its sister question as of closing, at 11:59 ET on October 1, 2021. The consensus crowd forecast is always shown under \"Crowd Forecast\" button. It's the mean of the 68% most-recent forecasts. The bins are up to but not including the upper boundary, meaning, for example, in the unlikely event the consensus forecast is exactly 30%, the 30%-40% bin will be correct. Foretell staff reserve the right to omit forecasts when calculating the crowd consensus if we have reason to believe they were made in bad faith. In such a case, we will communicate to forecasters that we are omitting forecasts, and the effect on the consensus forecast, as soon as we are aware of the problem.Why are we asking these questions? If we will never know the ground truth for a question, we cannot score it in the conventional manner. Many questions of this form are of great interest, however. A new method for scoring unresolvable questions -- called \"reciprocal scoring\" -- treats the crowd consensus as the ground truth and scores forecasters based on how close their forecasts are to the crowd consensus. See Karger, Monrad, Mellers, Tetlock, \"Accelerating the Evaluation of Policy Options in Crises: The COVID-19 Pandemic\" [Forthcoming]. For a similar method, see Hypermind's Drip Rewards.For this pair of questions, we're treating the crowd consensus on October 1, 2021 as the ground truth. This question is effectively asking two questions: (i) what new information about the origins of COVID-19 do you expect to be available by October 1, 2021, and (ii) what impact do you expect it will have on the consensus view of the crowd.***To suggest a change or clarification to this question, please select Request Clarification from the green gear-shaped dropdown button to the right of the question.&nbsp;",

    "question": "Besides El Salvador, will no other countries classify Bitcoin as legal tender by December 31, 2021?",
    "id": "C163",
    "background": "Context. On June 9, 2021, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced that the Salvadoran Congress had voted to make Bitcoin legal tender. Legal tender is money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for a monetary debt. Making cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, legal tender has several benefits for developing countries without sophisticated financial systems. For one, it makes their economy less vulnerable to inflation caused by the actions of other country's central banks. Bukele cited recent actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the motivations for El Salvador's new law. Second, it makes it easier to send money without having a bank account. El Salvadorans living outside the country sent $5.92 billion to friends and family in El Salvador in 2020. According to Bukele, \"a big chunk of those 6 billion dollars is lost to intermediaries.\" Third, it makes their economy more attractive to crypto entrepreneurs. There are risks, however. According to The Independent, \"Speculation within bitcoin forums and among crypto commentators on Twitter is that the US could target El Salvador with sanctions, as it represents a threat to the strength of the US dollar - the other official currency of the country. One way to potentially mitigate against this risk would be for countries that accept bitcoin as legal tender to form an economic alliance.\"Paraguay and Panama appear closest to making Bitcoin legal tender, with politicians in both countries claiming they will introduce legislation similar to El Savador's. The Independent states that \"elected officials in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua have all spoken favourably about bitcoin, with some pledging to introduce legislation that is favourable to cryptocurrencies.\"Resolution details. This question resolves based on popular media reporting that a country other than El Salvador has taken the legal steps necessary to make Bitcoin legal tender. The question resolves positively if the legal steps, such as legislative approval of a new law, are completed by December 31, 2021, even if the law would not go into effect until a later date.***This question was proposed by Mauricio_B. To suggest a change or clarification to this question, please select Request Clarification from the green gear-shaped dropdown button to the right of the question.",

Bukele cited recent actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the motivations for El Salvador's new law. Second, it makes it easier to send money without having a bank account. El Salvadorans living outside the country sent $5.92 billion to friends and family in El Salvador in 2020. According to Bukele, \"a big chunk of those 6 billion dollars is lost to intermediaries.\" Third, it makes their economy more attractive to crypto entrepreneurs. There are risks, however. According to The Independent, \"Speculation within bitcoin forums and among crypto commentators on Twitter is that the US could target El Salvador with sanctions, as it represents a threat to the strength of the US dollar - the other official currency of the country. One way to potentially mitigate against this risk would be for countries that accept bitcoin as legal tender to form an economic alliance.\"Paraguay and Panama appear closest to making Bitcoin legal tender, with politicians in both countries claiming they will introduce legislation similar to El Savador's. The Independent states that \"elected officials in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua have all spoken favourably about bitcoin, with some pledging to introduce legislation that is favourable to cryptocurrencies.\"Resolution details. This question resolves based on popular media reporting that a country other than El Salvador has taken the legal steps necessary to make Bitcoin legal tender. The question resolves positively if the legal steps, such as legislative approval of a new law, are completed by December 31, 2021, even if the law would not go into effect until a later date.***This question was proposed by Mauricio_B. To suggest a change or clarification to this question, please select Request Clarification from the green gear-shaped dropdown button to the right of the question.",

    "id": "M1457",
    "background": "Angela Merkel has been head of German Government since 2005, when she was elected by the Bundestag into office. Her most recent, fourth cabinet was formed with the votes of CDU/CSU and SPD, a so-called grand coalition. A brief overview on her: Merkel entered politics shortly after the Berlin Wall fell, joining a local political party that later united with the CDU. She stood for election in her constituency shortly after reunification of former East Germany with West Germany, becoming a member of Bundestag, a position she’s held since 1991. In the CDU and parliament she was quickly recognised for her competency and appointed Minister for Women and Youth by Helmut Kohl, later promoted to Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety. With the defeat of the CDU federal elections in 1998 Merkel became secretary-general in her party, a prominent and powerful position. She was elected party leader of the CDU in 2000, after her patron (and also former party leader) Kohl and his chosen successor in the CDU tripped over a party funding scandal. She didn’t become contender for chancellor for the following election because of party politics, but ran in 2005, when she won a hair’s breadth victory. She’s now the third longest running chancellor, and will be the second longest if her cabinet lasts till the end of the current Bundestag. Given the recent controversies and the rise of populist right-wing party AfD that isn’t a given, though. If there was a federal election, the AfD would be the second strongest party after CDU/CSU, and a grand coalition would both look decidedly different than now and still result in only a minority government.

    "question": "Will an airborne wind energy system of at least 100kW not be sold before 2022?",
    "id": "M2578",
    "background": "Context Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems, essentially wind turbines in the sky (e.g. on kites or planes), have been promised for many years. There are several companies, many in Europe, that are working on AWE systems, including (but not limited to): KITE KRAFT Kitepower SkySails Group Ampyx Power SkyPull The basic advantages of AWE's are that one does not need a tower and therefore can use much less construction material to achieve the same amount of power, resulting in significant cost efficiencies.

But in the short term, this could also be acheived by simply constraining Alphastar to mimic the human keystroke and mouse movement data that it already has access to. Right now the AI plays the game in ways that are probably impossible for humans to reproduce, but a properly constrained AI could discover the theoretical optimal strategies and meta for humans, which the player community could then learn from. Such accurately representative simulations would also make it possible to design a more perfectly balanced version of the game, as well as reliably dictate a meta that encourages desired play styles. This could be done for the professional scene in particular, but also for all other levels of player proficiency. It could perhaps be possible to create AIs on demand that play in various predefined styles, e.g. mimic individual human players, or play at a skill level so accurately defined that it can serve as the new benchmark for player rankings and leagues.

A promising possibility is xenotransplantation, in which animal, e.g. pig, organs are substituted for human ones. This is a surprisingly viable possibility, and would provide an array of advantages (other than perhaps to the pig.) There are two significant problems. First, non-human organs tend to be rejected very quickly by human hosts. Second, pig cells in particular create a host of native viruses (even without infection) and there is significant concern that these might adapt to be new human pathogens if widely placed in human hosts. Nonetheless significant progress is being made in addressing both challenges; for example this startup is apparently testing pig organ transplants into nonhuman primates. When will the first pig (or other nonprimate) organ be successfully used in a human? The organ should be a kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, or lung. We'll define \"successful\" as the organ functioning for 30 days after transplantation.",

    "question": "What will the upper limit in the IPCC's assessed 'likely' range of equilibrium climate sensitivity, in its sixth Assessment Report?",
    "id": "M3205",
    "background": "Climate sensitivity is arguably the most important number in climate change. It is the global-mean surface temperature change associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration over its preindustrial value (Vial et al. 2013). The standard metric for climate sensitivity is the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) given as the change in temperature at equilibrium for a doubling of CO2, neglecting long-term feedbacks associated with vegetation changes, carbon feedbacks and ice sheet dynamics (Skeie et al. 2017). The first attempt to calculate climate sensitivity was in 1896, by the Swedish scientist, Svante Arrhenius. He found that CO2 doubling should increase the Earth's mean temperature by 5–6°C (Lapenis, 2006). Since then, hundreds of estimates have been made based on climate modelling and/or estimates based on physical evidence, such as climate changes in the distant past (Knutti et al., 2017). Some have argued that from the 1980s onward, the uncertainty in climate projections has not narrowed appreciably, despite tremendous increases in computing power, in observations, and in the number of scientists studying the problem. For instance, In 2013, the IPCC widened the range of its estimate of climate sensitivity once again, opting for the \"likely\" range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C (66% confidence interval) (Freeman et al., 2015). The resolution of this dilemma has important implications for climate research and policy. The ‘likely’ range (i.e. its 66% confidence interval) of ECS as stated in the IPCC's 5th annual report (IPCC, 2014) is 1.5–4.5 degrees Celsius. This is the same range that was givien in the IPCC's first report (IPCC, 1990). A 2018 article aims to revise the estimate of climate sensitivity, and reduces the range of possible end-of-century outcomes by more than half. It finds a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC ‘likely’ range) of 2.2–3.4 degrees Celsius. The IPCC's sixth report is currently scheduled for publication in 2022, will it revise its upper bound of 4.5 degrees Celsius of its ‘likely’ range? What will the upper limit in the IPCC's assessed 'likely' range of equilibrium climate sensitivity, in its sixth Assessment Report? Resolution This question resolves as the upper of the 66% confidence limits, i.e. the upper number of its 'likely' range, of the IPCC's estimate for climate sensitivity in its Sixth Assessment Report. The question resolves ambiguous if the sixth Assessment Report is not published before the end of 2024, or if it does not issue the estimate in its report. In case of format changes to the IPCC's representation of their estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity (i.e. different confidence interval is presented), an admin shall examine the relevant technical publication(s) produced by the IPCC, or those that principally inform the IPCC estimates for climate sensitivity, to work out the associated 66% confidence interval from their cumulative probability function (CDF). In case different confidence intervals are provided and the relevant CDF is not disclosed, we shall assume that the CDF is equivalent to the analytic form found in Roe and Baker (2007), so that the 66% confidence interval can be worked out by an admin.",

    "id": "M3520",
    "background": "Solar photovoltaics (PV) generate electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons by the photovoltaic effect. Solar pv generated around 2% of total energy in the U.S. in 2017. In Germany, an estimated 7% of net generated electricity was solar-generated in 2017. Solar energy production is cleaner than most non-renewable energy production. For example, according to the IPCC, the life cycle CO2 equivalent of energy production by rooftop solar cells is 41 co2 equivalent per kWh, which is less than 1/10 of that from the energy production by gas. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in 2018, the weighted-average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV was USD 0.085/kWh (IRENA, 2019). This was 13% lower than for projects commissioned in 2017 (ibid.). What will the global weighted-average levelized cost of energy of utility-scale solar PV be in 2020, in 2018 USD per kWh? Resolution This question resolves as the global weighted-average LCOE of utility-scale solar PV be in 2020, in 2018 USD per kWh, per IRENA estimates. Prices are to be converted to 2018 USD using BLS CPI for all urban consumers and all items. In case IRENA data is not available, other sources of estimates of the global weighted-average LCOE of solar PV may be consulted. These other sources should be deemed by an admin to be sufficiently similar in methodology. One criterion of similarity is that the estimate of the 2018 LCOE solar PV is not more than 25% different from $0.085/kWh in 2018 USD.",

    "question": "When will multi-modal ML out-perform uni-modal ML?",
    "id": "M4235",
    "background": "Human infant learning integrates information across senses -- sight, sound, touch, etc. -- but current state of the art machine learning models usually use only one of these types. It remains to be seen whether integrating data across modes is necessary for achieving human-level intelligence. In contemporary machine learning (ML) research, we are mostly interested in image, text, graph, and video data. State of the art models in each of these domains train only on inputs of that specific domain; let's call this uni-modal training. By extension, if a model were to train on two or more of these input types, while evaluating on only one, we'll call that multi-modal training with uni-modal evaluation. For the purposes of this question, we are only interested in uni-modal evaluation tasks, so robotics and driving benchmarks are out of the question. Question Description: When will a multi-modal trained model out-perform the previous state of the art on one of the following uni-modal benchmarks: ImageNet WikiText-103 Cityscapes Additional uni-modal benchmarks from paperswithcode.com may be added to reflect trends in machine learning research. I will review paperswithcode.com two and four years after this question opens to request that moderators add the two most popular benchmarks which have more new entries (since June 1, 2020) than at least two thirds of the above benchmarks. If one of the newly added benchmarks involves data of the same type as one of the above benchmarks (i.e. image classification, text, image segmentation), and has more new entries, then the old benchmark will be superseded, and removed from the list. Resolution Condition: This question resolves as the first date on which one of the benchmarks above has a #1 ranked paper which sets the record using a multi-modal trained model. If no such paper is listed before 2030, then the question resolves as >01/01/2030. Specifics and Caveats: Multi-modal pre-training counts towards resolution. For text tasks, training on video counts if, and only if the image stream is used -- i.e. not just the audio stream. For image tasks, training on video counts if, and only if the audio stream is used -- i.e. not just the image stream. If paperswithcode.com shuts down or permanently stops updating their data, then the question resolves as ambiguous.",

    "question": "When will US domestic passenger air travel return to 80% of pre-COVID-19 volumes?",
    "id": "M4719",
    "background": "Context Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the US in February 2020, a series of international travel restrictions and statewide stay-at-home orders were put in place. The impact on the aviation industry has been severe. According to Conde Nast Traveler: On April 7, the total amount of U.S. fliers screened by the TSA fell below 100,000 for the first time in the agency’s history. That’s a 95 percent drop compared to the passenger numbers from the same day in 2019, when 2,091,056 people passed through the checkpoints. Experts say the majority of those screened were airline crew members or healthcare workers heading to COVID-19 hot spots. Some states have begun reopening, but domestic airline executives have warned that their operations may not come back in full force after the pandemic. These were the domestic passenger Departures Performed numbers for the year of 2019: January 2019 676,190 February 2019 615,986 March 2019 738,969 April 2019 719,238 May 2019 751,725 June 2019 754,175 July 2019 783,588 August 2019 783,830 September 2019 716,792 October 2019 750,827 November 2019 703,616 December 2019 728,899 Question When will US domestic passenger air travel return to 80% of pre-COVID-19 volumes? Resolution This question resolves as the first time when the total monthly US domestic passenger Departures Performed is at least 80% of that for the same month in 2019, according to US Air Carrier Traffic Statistics. To pin down a specific day, we will linearly interpolate between the last day of the first month when the air passenger volume meets the threshold and the last day of the prior month. Specifically, let the difference at month k be Δ k  ≡ y k −0.8× y 2019 k , and let t 1 be the last day of the last month with Δ 1 <0 , and let t 2 be the last day of the first month with Δ 2 ≥0. Then the exact resolution date will be given by t res = t 1 +( t 2 − t 1 )( Δ 1 Δ 1 − Δ 2 ). Related Questions Will American Airlines file for bankruptcy protection before 2021?

However, five years later, New Shepard has made a total of twelve publicly-known flights and has still never flown humans. When will Blue Origin send a paying customer to space? This question resolves as the date when Blue Origin or its successor organization (where succession through mergers, etc. is at the discretion of the admins) sends paying customer(s) to space, as determined by credible media reports. A paying customer is a human that either pays Blue Origin for the flight, or is paid for by another organization such as NASA. It must be evident that money or equivalent consideration (stock, etc.) changed hands in an arm's-length transaction. In particular, they cannot be Blue Origin employees, test pilots, or investors. The customer(s) in question must exceed an altitude of 100 km, return to Earth, and safely exit the launch vehicle. The vehicle need not be New Shepard, but Blue Origin must be the primary manufacturer. If it turns out that this has already occurred (as Blue Origin often announces an achievement well after the fact), the question resolves as the lower bound, not as ambiguous.",

    "question": "Will Antifa not officially be labelled a terrorist organization in the US before 2022?",
    "id": "M4946",
    "background": "US president Trump has declared his intentions to add Antifa to list of terrorist organizations, tweeting May 31st: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. US Texan Senator Ted Cruz has similarly been campaigning for this move: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is aiming to highlight the role Antifa and like-minded groups are playing in riots across the country, convening a Senate hearing Tuesday on the issue while alleging that radical left-wing groups are engaging in \"organized terror attacks\" designed to tear down government institutions. “Across the country, we’re seeing horrific violence, we’re seeing our country torn apart. Violent anarchists and Marxists are exploiting protests to transform them into riots and direct assaults on the lives and safety of their fellow Americans,” Cruz told Fox News in an interview. Unsurprisingly Trump's opponents have opposed this move, and even labelled it impossible. For instance, in Slate, we can read: While the president and attorney general may have political motivations for wanting to stigmatize a left-wing movement by tagging it with the terrorist label and thus seek to assign blame for the violence engulfing several U.S. major cities, it is unlikely that Trump can do so within existing legal authorities. In the United States, there are two competent authorities for designating terrorist groups. First, the Department of State can designate groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. It can also designate both groups and individuals as terrorists under Executive Order 13224. This order was established shortly after Sept. 11 as part of an effort to provide the State and Treasury departments enhanced capability to block terrorists from the U.S. formal financial system. However, for the State Department to designate a group, it must document that the organization operates overseas, and that the group’s leaders, camps, and operations are based outside of the continental United States. Antifa, by virtue of its domestic presence and lack of any organizational cohesion, would be impossible for the State Department to designate. The Treasury Department can also sanction terrorists per Executive Order 13224. But it can only piggy-back on an already existing designation of a group, typically one that is already labeled by the State Department as a terrorist organization. Without an underlying State Department designation, the Treasury Department can’t act. And, while Treasury has designated a number of domestic-based charities as terrorist entities, those groups were linked to foreign organizations such as Hamas, the Tamil Tigers, Lebanese Hizballah, and al-Qaida. So it appears to be difficult for the Trump administration to accomplish this. Thus, the question is: Will Antifa officially be labelled a terrorist organization in the US before 2022? Antifa must be added to an official list of terrorist organizations for this to resolve positively. They must remain on this list for at least seven consecutive days. It must happen before 2022. It can happen under any presidency (winner of 2020 US election). An \"official list is\" one that appears on the public-facing website of a US federal agency.",

The SEC accuses McAfee of being paid more than $23.1 million worth of cryptocurrency assets for promoting a number of ICO token sales without disclosing that he was being paid to do so. Furthermore the DOJ has levied a number of counts of tax evasion against McAfee, saying that he “willfully attempted to evade” payment of income taxes owed to the federal government. In a brief announcing the arrest and unsealing of indictment documents, the DOJ also details that the charges are confined to McAfee the individual and that they did not find any connection with the “anti-virus company bearing his name.” The DOJ’s charges against McAfee are a bit dry, but detail 10 counts against the entrepreneur. McAfee faced five counts of tax evasion, which each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, as well as five counts of “willful failure to file a tax return,” each carrying a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The SEC filing is a much more interesting read, with 55 pages detailing a lengthy investigation into McAfee’s alleged fraudulent activity promoting a number of ICOs throughout 2017 and 2018. The report specifically notes that McAfee allegedly received more than $11.6 million worth of BTC and ETH tokens for promoting seven ICOs. Unfortunately, those offerings were not named in the suit. He additionally received $11.5 million worth of the promoted tokens, the suit alleges. Will John McAfee receive a prison term of at least 3 years?

If he receives a lighter or no prison sentence, it resolves negatively. If McAfee avoids extraction to USA and in this way avoids facing charges, the question resolves negatively at the closing date. Positive resolution does not require McAfee to actually finish his three year sentence.

More than 1 million deaths have been directly attributed to the disease. Which month of 2021 will see the biggest global increase of COVID-19 cases? Resolution Criteria: This question will resolve based on the best available data for the whole world in 2021 as made available by WHO before the end of March 2022. The month with the highest number of new cases will be selected. The new cases in a month should be computed as a simple difference between the best estimate of cases at the end and at the beginning of that month. Preferably based on Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports - situation in numbers, total cases, globally. For example the number of new cases in February 2020 (75,2k) is the total number of cases at the end of February 2020 (85k) minus the total number of cases at the end of January 2020 (9,8k). If the daily situation reports are not available, other data provided by WHO or ECDC can be used, at the discretion of Metaculus.

    "question": "What will be the differential in sales between the most-sold and second most-sold consumer electric vehicles in America in 2021?",
    "id": "M5560",
    "background": "Electric vehicles are notoriously expensive, a reason that often pushes the average consumer to buy combustion engine automobiles or the cheaper hybrid options. A major reason for the high pricing points of EVs are the lithium-ion batteries which fuel them. 51% of the cost of an electric vehicle resides in its powertrain, which includes the car’s battery, controllers, inverters, and transmission equipment. With new announcements from Tesla’s battery day, and a publicized shift to the use and production of lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFPs) and high nickel batteries, electric vehicles are predicted to see their production costs fall, thereby bringing down the overall market price. Low prices could dramatically impact consumer adoption and increase EV production, which could help change the tide of carbon emissions in protecting the environment. Just in the United States, if everyone drove an electric vehicle, carbon emissions would drop around 8.4%. It is possible to ascertain both producer dynamics in the market and competition levels, as well as consumer preferences with regards to EV criteria by looking at sales differences between models on the market. This could help greatly with understanding both the industry as it grows, and what EV factors influence greater adoption levels by consumers. What will be the differential in sales between the most-sold and second most-sold consumer electric vehicles in America in 2021? Resolution criteria for the most-sold models will come from the US Department of Energy’s AFDC which provides an infographic with the number of sale deliveries of each light-duty, electric model by company. In 2019 the most sold vehicle was Tesla Model 3 with 154,840 vehicles sold in the US, followed by the Prius PHEV at 23,630. The price differential between these two models is great (over $11,000 starting price). In 2017, the Tesla Model S sold 26,500 which was followed by the Chevy Bolt with 23,297, a relatively small difference (with an average price difference of over $60,000). Here we can see that there is something about the Tesla Model 3, and/or the changing industry dynamics over time, that is greatly affecting adoption. We also see a dramatic reduction in price difference between the offerings, perhaps due to battery costs. If data is no longer provided, then this question will resolve ambiguously. Price data was taken using starting price levels for each model by the year it was produced using a google search. Prices are not adjusted for subsidies, and approximations serve well in an estimation of general price difference.",

    "id": "M5574",
    "background": "China instituted the NEV (New Energy Vehicle) mandate “which promotes new energy vehicles, such as electric vehicles, and provides additional compliance flexibility to existing fuel consumption regulations.” This mandate applies to passenger vehicles only, and currently 60% of global car sales from China are covered by it. The NEV mandate specified credit targets for 2019 (10%) and 2020 (12%), but has recently expanded targets to 2021-23 as well. The International Energy Association (IEA) states that: “Each NEV is assigned a specific number of credits depending on metrics including electric range, energy efficiency, and rated power of fuel cell systems. Higher performance vehicles get more credits, capped at six credits per vehicle. These NEV credit targets thus may result in NEV market share falling into a range of values based on fleet mix. Assuming that all manufacturers produce vehicles with a per-vehicle NEV credit of three in 2020, for example, the market share of NEVs in China based on the number of vehicles sold would be around 4% in 2020 while still meeting the 12% target based on NEV credits.” China expects an NEV credit target of 14% in 2021 and a 2% increase for each following year until 2023, with an ending credit of 18%. Vehicle producers need to hit the number of credits needed each year, either by producing or importing a set number of new energy passenger vehicles. There is also a market for these credits which can be sold and traded between companies, as well as the option to use surplus credits to offset CAFC (Corporate Average Fuel Consumption) credit deficits. As credits grow, the number of electric vehicles in China’s fleet should increase and consumer adoption along with it, thereby greatly reducing the amount of carbon emissions from transportation and setting China on its path to become carbon neutral by 2060.

If and when a sufficient number of people receive these vaccines, in combination with immunity provided through naturally occurring antibodies among those previously infected, the population is expected to reach herd immunity. Current research suggests that herd immunity for COVID-19 is expected when 60-70% of a population is immune to the virus, either through vaccination or past infection. Early results from the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines suggest efficacy >90%. Early research results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 immunity is long-lasting and may be consistent with the long term immunity observed in SARS. On November 22nd, Dr. Slaoui, leader of Operation Warp Speed, stated that he expects herd immunity to likely be achieved in May 2021. 70% or so of the population being immunized would allow for true herd immunity to take place, that is likely to happen somewhere in the month of May, or something like that based on our plans. Dr. Slaoui, November 22nd, 2020 However, vaccine hestitancy may be high, with 42% of Americans in late October 2020 saying they would be unwilling to take a SARS-CoV-2. When will the United States reach herd immunity (>230M) for COVID-19? This question resolves as the date when the first reliable media report is published that states that >230M of the US population (~70%) have either received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or has been previously been infected by the virus.

    "id": "M5827",
    "background": "Background As new electric vehicle models enter the market with increasing ranges and falling prices, consumer interest is rising. We are tracking this consumer interest and general electric vehicle adoption through the number of charging stations available in the top ten states after California. We’ve selected cities in these states outside of the core areas of EV infrastructure and development, usually the largest metropolitan places, to observe general trends throughout the rest of the state. Boulder County, CO hosts the second largest number of public charging locations (153) in the state of Colorado. 90 of those chargers reside in Boulder, the largest city in Boulder County. However, according to ChargePoint’s map of charging locations across the United States, none those locations have the option for DC Fast charging. DC Fast charging, also known as level three charging, can provide up to 480 V of energy directly into the battery of an electric vehicle, significantly reducing charging time. Most electric vehicles can recharge 80% of their battery power in just under an hour using DC fast chargers. This makes them the perfect choice for charging infrastructure across public and private short term parking lots. AC, or level 2, charging requires the car to convert the energy into a direct current for the battery and can take 4 to 12 hours to charge the battery fully. This is currently the most predominant charging technology across America. However, many people running errands rarely stay parked in the same place for enough time to warrant plugging their vehicle into the level 2 chargers provided in some parking lots. DC chargers make up only 15% of the current charging infrastructure across the country, and could provide more accessible charging capabilities for electric vehicle drivers if properly developed. Currently, Boulder boasts a fleet of 5,342 electric vehicles, including battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles, within the city limits. With large public spaces like malls, hospitals, and universities, there exist many opportunities for charging infrastructure development. Main attractions in Boulder include Boulder Municipal Airport, Village Boulder Shopping Center, and the University of Colorado at Boulder. Colorado offers a variety of incentive programs to help fuel consumer demand. However, subsidies are expected to fall by $2,000 in 2021 and another $700 by 2023 as demand increases and adoption rates rise. Colorado recently passed legislation allowing consumers to buy directly from EV producers, bypassing the need for an official, established auto dealership, which should also increase access and availability of these vehicles for consumers. How many DC charging stations will Boulder, CO have by the end 2021? Resolution Criteria: Resolution criteria will be provided through ChargePoint’s map of electric vehicle charging locations. By entering the search words “Boulder, CO, USA” and limiting the selection of location to Level 3 charging units, including CCS, CHAdeMO, and Tesla chargers. Individual charging stations will appear on the right side of the map, and will list the city they reside in, as well as appearing on the map with the number of stations per location. The number of outlets is difficult to ascertain, and will not be used as a measurement at the city level. Make sure to check the city specifically when counting the total number of stations offered within city limits. Unfortunately, data on specific charging level stations is difficult to find, which makes using maps like those provided through AFDC and ChargePoint necessary in determining specific aspects of charging infrastructure development. If Metaculus admins and users feel that by the time of this resolution, data from this site is difficult to ascertain and there are better options provided through either independent or government sources, then the resolution will be provided through those sources or the question will resolve ambiguously. Data: Data on the number of total charging stations and outlets at each charging level for every state can be found here, but is not available at the country or city level for which this question requires. Historical data is difficult to find and configure as many sites constantly update their numbers, however, by recording current numbers on a spreadsheet at a set interval of time periods, trends in development should begin to show.",

Revelations at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Berejiklian had been in a long-term relationship with Daryl Maguire, a former member of state parliament and the subject of the commission's inquiry, have caused controversy. The ICAC revelations were followed by other missteps by the Premier, but whether they will jeopardise her position remains to be seen. The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor. Over the last 20 years, NSW has had seven premiers. Of these, one was defeated by a leadership spill, four resigned, and one lost an election. Notably, Barry O'Farrell resigned his premiership in 2014 after it was found he had misled the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The next election is scheduled for 25 March 2023, although the Governor can dissolve the Legislative Assembly earlier under limited circumstances.

The issuance of a presidential proclamation that fully lifts the suspension of travel from the Schengen Area will be considered for resolution. In the scenario that the U.S. lifts travel from the overall Schengen Area but keeps travel restrictions on some Schengen Area member countries, this will resolve if travel restrictions are lifted on at least 50% of Schengen Area countries, or at least 13 countries.

Q3, however, saw a bounce back with a 33% increase in GDP from Q2, a relief for the economically stricken United States.

As we progress into 2021, with a new COVID vaccine on the horizon and a new president entering the White House, the future of the US economy could reside in the passing of the next stimulus package. GDP growth requires consumer expenditure, and with more people saving money through the economic downturn (at rates over 6% higher than average), it is not expected to increase unless additional stimuli are provided to consumers. With the addition of a stimulus package, most likely released by Q2 2021, total GDP growth for 2021 is expected to reach 4.4%. What will be the U.S. GDP growth (year on year) at the end of 2021?

    "id": "M5928",
    "background": "Oil, arguably one of most important commodities in the world, is vital for understanding the global economy. The price for any commodity is driven through the intersection between consumer demand and production supply, so we can effectively use the price of oil to understand complications in consumer/producer dynamics. We use oil for everything; for transportation, industry, agricultural, and residential needs. The transportation industry is the greatest consumer of oil by far, at 68% use in all transportation needs for the US and 56% globally. However, with the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic in 2020, global transportation demand has fallen as fewer people travel both domestically and abroad. An oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia during 2020 also caused production stressors. These supply and demand shocks significantly dropped the price of US oil to under $40/barrel in early September 2020. The US Energy Information Association (EIA) has published its 2021 predictions: “The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that Brent prices will average $49/b in 2021, up from an expected average of $43/b in the fourth quarter of 2020. The forecast for higher crude oil prices next year reflects EIA's expectation that while inventories will remain high, they will decline with rising global oil demand and restrained OPEC+ oil production. EIA forecasts Brent prices will average $47/b in the first quarter of 2021 and rise to an average of $50/b by the fourth quarter.” What will be the WTI oil price in December 2021? Resolution criteria for this question will be obtained from the Federal Reserve and will represent the global price of WTI crude oil for the month of December 2021. Data is recorded in US Dollars and is not seasonally adjusted. Data can be retrieved from 1990 onward, and formatted into spreadsheets.",

    "background": "Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur and philanthropist from New York City who ran a surprisingly effective long-shot Democratic primary campaign in the 2020 Presidential election. He was noted for his quirky, upbeat campaigning style and raucous online fanbase. New York mayor Bill de Blasio is ineligible to run for re-election in November 2021 due to term limits. With 70% of New York voters registered as Democrats to only 10% Republicans, the election to replace him is in effect the Democratic Party mayoral primary on June 22, 2021. There are already several strong declared and potential candidates, including city Comptroller Scott Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. As of mid-December, 2020, Yang is widely regarded as a candidate although he has yet made no public declaration. In 2021, for the first time, New York's municipal elections will use a ranked-choice or \"instant runoff\" system. Voters rank up to five candidates in preference order, and if no candidate has an outright majority of first-round votes, an algorithm analogous to multiple rounds of eliminations and runoff elections produces an eventual winner. What proportion of last-round votes will Andrew Yang get in the 2021 New York mayoral primary election? This question will resolve as the proportion of votes recieved by Yang in the last round, after enough candidates have been eliminated to give one candidate 50% or greater votes. If Yang is eliminated before the last round is reached, it will resolve as 0%. Fine print",

    "question": "What will be the average percentage change in property and casualty insurance premiums in Q1 2022?",
    "id": "M5994",
    "background": "Context The property and casualty insurance market is a $1.6 trillion industry, and according to McKinsey, “remains one of the few industries that has yet to be disrupted.” P&C insurance premiums represent an important metric for business owners as they plan for the cost of protecting their businesses from risk. According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners: Soft market conditions have gripped the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry since 2007. Some characteristics of a soft market are flat or declining rates, more relaxed underwriting standards, and increased competition among insurers. Following the industry’s 2017 highest-ever losses, predominantly caused by a catastrophic increase in climate related incidents such as wildfires, flooding, and the hurricane season, the P&C insurance market saw a 49.5% net income increase in 2018, followed by a 7.9% net income increase in 2019. According to the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers: Premium pricing increased an average of 3.5 percent in Q1 2019, compared to 2.4 percent in Q4 2018 and 1.6 percent in Q3 2018. The same report identifies the highest premium increase in the last 10 years as 28.5% in Q4 of 2001. COVID-19 appears to be precipitating a hardening of the market, and CIAB reports that premium prices across all-sized accounts increased by an average of 9.6% in Q1 2020, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of premium increases. CIAB's report from Q2 2020 states that: \"The average premium price increase for all-sized accounts broke double digits in Q2 2020, at 10.8%, compared to 9.3% in Q1 and 7.5% in Q4 2019.\" What will be the average percentage change in property and casualty insurance premiums in Q1 2022? Resolution Criteria This question will resolve according to CIAB’s Quarterly Market Outlook report for Q1 2022. A question for Q1 2021 can be found here",

    "id": "M6008",
    "background": "On December 16th, 2020 England’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the UK. Amid worries that the new variant may be more transmissible, PM Boris Johnson announced new lockdowns in London and England's southeast, including a ban on Christmas gatherings. The new variant is said to account for 60% of the infections in London. The spread of a new variant has prompted concerns that a mutation in SARS-CoV-2 could lead to the currently approved vaccines and treatments becoming less effective. The British Medical Journal has the following to say about this possibility: The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the three leading vaccines are targeting. However, vaccines produce antibodies against many regions in the spike protein, so it’s unlikely that a single change would make the vaccine less effective. Over time, as more mutations occur, the vaccine may need to be altered. This happens with seasonal flu, which mutates every year, and the vaccine is adjusted accordingly. The SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn’t mutate as quickly as the flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved effective in trials are types that can easily be tweaked if necessary. Peacock said, “With this variant there is no evidence that it will evade the vaccination or a human immune response. But if there is an instance of vaccine failure or reinfection then that case should be treated as high priority for genetic sequencing.” If there is a mutation and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be updated, it is possible the United States CDC will start recommending revaccination with an updated vaccine. This question asks how likely that scenario is. Before 2023, will the United States CDC recommend that those who have already been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) be vaccinated again due to a mutation in the virus?

    "background": "From Wikipedia: Elden Ring began development in early 2017 following the release of The Ringed City, a piece of downloadable content for Dark Souls III. As with Miyazaki's Souls games, Elden Ring will have the ability for players to create their own custom characters instead of playing as a fixed protagonist. Miyazaki also considered Elden Ring to be a more \"natural evolution\" to the Souls series, as the game will be much larger in scale compared to them, featuring an open world with new gameplay mechanics such as horseback riding and combat. However, unlike many other open world games, Elden Ring will not feature populated towns with non-player characters, with the world having numerous dungeon-like ruins in place of them instead. When asked about the possibility of the story being novelized, Miyazaki stated that he would rather have players experience it themselves by playing the game, as he thinks that the game's secrets and mysteries would be spoiled otherwise. The score is being written by Yuka Kitamura, who has composed for many of Miyazaki's previous games. As of the creation of this question (December 2020), no gameplay footage for Elden Ring has been released. When will FromSoftware release Elden Ring? This will resolve to the date on which Elden Ring is first released for sale to the public in any region. Any release of an alpha, beta, and/or 0.X version of the game does not count. If Elden Ring is not released before January 1, 2026, then this question resolves as \">January 1, 2026\". In case the game is released under a different name the question resolves only if the game is essentially that which the relevant gamers recognise to be what \"Elden Ring\" previously referred to, according to moderators and/or admins.",

    "background": "A definition courtesy of FRED: An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program. A falling number of initial jobless claims is generally interpreted as indicating an improving economic situation, and a rising number vice versa. Before 2020-03-21, initial jobless claims had been below 300k for over 5 years, or 263 consecutive weeks. In the data series going back to 1967, the figure had never exceeded 700k. Initial claims for the week ending 2020-03-21 were 3.3MM, 11.7x the previous week's figure and 4.7x the previous record set in 1982. And the following week saw claims more than double to 6.8MM. Weekly initial claims have been mostly falling since then. When will US initial jobless claims fall below 300 thousand?

With COVID-19 hitting the industries which often employ younger workers, such as leisure and hospitality, employment for the age group of young workers (16-24) jumped from 8% to almost 25% between spring of 2019 and 2020. Young workers are expected to face significant hardship in the labor market even after the end of the pandemic, with long run negative effects in their futures, mimicking the economic downturn and effects brought about for young workers by the Great Recession in 2008. As young workers attempt to enter the workforce to support their families, find jobs after college, or pay for their current education, monitoring their employment levels could act as an important measure of the health and growth of the economy.

    "background": "Background The US Labor Force is aging. As the population ages and social security flounders, more people over the age of 65 find themselves rejoining the workforce and entering the job market. The AARP finds that: “As of February 2019, more than 20 percent of adults over age 65 are either working or looking for work, compared with 10 percent in 1985, says the report from United Income, a financial planning and investment management company targeted to those ages 50 to 70. The study analyzed data from the Current Population Survey, a report compiled monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS expects the trend of older people working to continue, estimating that 13 million Americans age 65 and older will be in the labor force by 2024.” Oldest workers over 65 years of age were disproportionately hit hardest by the economic downturn of the Coronavirus with a drop of 16.6% in employment levels. Health risks also affect older workers, forcing them to exit the workforce in efforts to protect against the harmful effects of the Coronavirus. “In April and May, workers aged 65 and older had higher unemployment rates than those between the ages of 25 and 54—a scenario that Johnson says is unique to this recession. Older workers' seniority had protected them in earlier downturns, leading to lower unemployment rates than their younger counterparts. Johnson believes the change is a sign of how the virus is affecting older workers' employment amid this recession. \"I think this is going to be a trend,\" he says.” How many people 65+ will be employed in the US in 2021 (in thousands)?

    "background": "Background The number of people employed in the US educational systems rose approximately 1.2 million over the last decade between 2011 and 2019. However, this growth is not expected to continue. By 2026, only 300,000 more people are expected to be employed in this industry, an unpleasant reality for a country with a government which routinely cuts the budgets for its public education facilities. In February of 2020, President Trump announced a new plan which would cut the education budgets by 8%. He also supported plans to cut standardized loans for students enrolling in higher education. With resources already stretched thin during the economic crisis brought by COVID-19 in 2020, higher education institutions are forced to continue furloughing employees due to decreased governmental support and student tuition payments. Teachers and staff in secondary schools across the country are also being asked to take pay cuts and furloughed days. Going forward, with new political leaders in federal and state governments, and a COVID-19 vaccine on the way, we should hopefully see budgets increase and teachers and staff returning to their positions in 2021. President Elect Biden has promised to triple funding to K-12 programs serving low income students, to an estimated $48 billion dollars, with requirements that most of the money initially go to teachers. How many people will be employed in the US education industry in 2021 (in thousands)? Resolution Criteria Resolution criteria will come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics through their reports on the Labor Force Statistics taken from the Current Population Survey. It should represent the total amount of employment in the industry as a whole as observed in their annual industry tables. Historical data is also available for more detailed analysis and information. In 2019, over 14 million people were employed in this industry, up from just under 13 million in 2011.",

    "background": "3 million extra people were employed in the US healthcare and social services industries between 2011 and 2019 to a total of approximately 22 million people, making the healthcare industry the largest employer across the United States. However, with the onset of COVID-19, employment in healthcare fell 7.8% from February to April 2020. Health-based employment fell primarily across office based jobs, with the greatest effects seen by dentists’ offices at unemployment rates over 50%. As the possibility of tele-health becomes more available with changes in the market from COVID-19, these downward trends in growth could continue for office-based health care jobs. While unemployment increased throughout the sector, it fell most hard upon women, who saw unemployment levels in office jobs peak at 11.2%, compared to 6.8% for men. For hospital workers, who were required more for in-person care during the pandemic, unemployment remained roughly the same.

The Crete earthquake was followed by a tsunami which devastated the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, particularly Libya, Alexandria and the Nile Delta, killing thousands and hurling ships 3 km (1.9 mi) inland. Will there be a 7.0 or larger earthquake either somewhere under or within 81 Kilometres the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in 2021? This question will resolve if by Dec. 31 2021 an earthquake measuring 7.0 or larger occurring either underneath or within 80 Kilometres from sea shores of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, being defined as a line running from Southern Sicily thru Malta to Misrata Libya. This will include the whole Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, and Leviathan Sea. Earthquake must be verified by either: European-Mediterranean Seismological Center Earthquake Track",

It was the biggest expansion ever, following a record 31.4% plunge in Q2, as the economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. Q4 saw a 4% growth rate and Metaculus estimates that the Q1 growth rate for 2021 will be 4.67. What will the US Q2 2021 GDP growth rate be according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis Advance Estimate? Resolution Criteria This data is expected to be released sometime in early Q3 2021.

A third Ebola case this week has been confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo.

An outbreak that began in 2018 and the WHO declared over in June 2020 killed more than 2,000 people.

    "background": "On 7 February 2021, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after the laboratory confirmation of one case in North Kivu Province. The case was an adult female living in Biena Health Zone. To date the source of infection is still under investigation. A third Ebola case this week has been confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo. The case was found in Butembo, a city of over one million people and the epicentre of a major outbreak of the disease that was declared over last June after nearly two years. This new cluster marks the 12th outbreak of Ebola in Congo. Thousands of people have died from the virus in Congo in recent years. An outbreak that began in 2018 and the WHO declared over in June 2020 killed more than 2,000 people. As of February 12 2021, two people are reported to have died due to Ebola infection in the latest outbreak. Will there be at least 1,000 Ebola deaths in 2021? This question resolves positively if the WHO, or credible media reports, indicate that at least 1,000 persons have died in 2021 due to Ebola infection. Note that this question refers to the total number of Ebola deaths in the year 2021, not in any particular outbreak. If there are multiple outbreaks, deaths from all of them will count towards this question.",

What fraction of hospitalised COVID-19 patients will still experience symptoms after 12 months? This question will resolve according to a published estimate from PHOSP, of the fraction of hospitalised patients enrolled in the study who displayed symptoms 12+ months later. Symptoms may be of any sort considered clinically relevant by PHOSP. As a non-exhaustive example of what they are currently investigating, their about page states: The range and severity of symptoms arising from the virus is broad, from those with no or minimal symptoms, to severe pneumonia in 15-20 per cent of cases, with evidence of widespread disease beyond the lungs, including the heart and circulatory system, kidney damage and effects on the brain.

    "id": "M6709",
    "background": "On 2 March, President Biden publicly announced that the U.S. is \"on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.\" There are approximately 255 million adults in the U.S. President Biden's announcement came shortly after the U.S. FDA authorized the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine on 27 February and Merck announced on 2 March that it would help manufacture the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the third vaccine to be authorized for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. Will sufficient SARS-CoV-2 vaccine supply for all U.S. adults be allocated by 31 May 2021? This will resolve on the basis of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation data provided by the CDC and HHS. Specifically, given that in the U.S. the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are currently two-dose regimens and the Johnson & Johnson is currently single-dose, the sum of the following will be taken for resolution: 1: total Pfizer second dose allocations (29,953,950 as of week of 1 March) 2: total Moderna second dose allocations (32,818,500 as of week of 1 March) 3: total Johnson & Johnson allocations (2,833,400 as of week of 1 March) So as of the week of March 1, there have been enough vaccines allocated for 65,605,850 Americans, which is 25.7% of the U.S. adult population. This questions asks whether enough vaccines will be allocated for at least 100% of U.S. adults for the week of 31 May 2021. Any other vaccines are authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA before 31 May can count toward allocation totals. If the U.S. federal government says by 31 May that it has enough vaccine doses to fully vaccinate all adult Americans but does not allocate enough doses accordingly (due to anticipated vaccine hesitancy, for instance), then a best attempt will be made to verify the U.S. federal government's claim by summing up the most recent data made available via press releases by vaccine manufacturers and/or credible media reporting.",

    "id": "M6709",
    "background": "On 2 March, President Biden publicly announced that the U.S. is \"on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.\" There are approximately 255 million adults in the U.S. President Biden's announcement came shortly after the U.S. FDA authorized the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine on 27 February and Merck announced on 2 March that it would help manufacture the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the third vaccine to be authorized for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. Will sufficient SARS-CoV-2 vaccine supply for all U.S. adults be allocated by 31 May 2021? This will resolve on the basis of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation data provided by the CDC and HHS. Specifically, given that in the U.S. the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are currently two-dose regimens and the Johnson & Johnson is currently single-dose, the sum of the following will be taken for resolution: 1: total Pfizer second dose allocations (29,953,950 as of week of 1 March) 2: total Moderna second dose allocations (32,818,500 as of week of 1 March) 3: total Johnson & Johnson allocations (2,833,400 as of week of 1 March) So as of the week of March 1, there have been enough vaccines allocated for 65,605,850 Americans, which is 25.7% of the U.S. adult population. This questions asks whether enough vaccines will be allocated for at least 100% of U.S. adults for the week of 31 May 2021. Any other vaccines are authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA before 31 May can count toward allocation totals. If the U.S. federal government says by 31 May that it has enough vaccine doses to fully vaccinate all adult Americans but does not allocate enough doses accordingly (due to anticipated vaccine hesitancy, for instance), then a best attempt will be made to verify the U.S. federal government's claim by summing up the most recent data made available via press releases by vaccine manufacturers and/or credible media reporting.",

    "id": "M6782",
    "background": "In the United States, Abortion has been a divisive social issue before Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Court in 1973, and has remained controversial since. Roe established the essential right of a mother's choice to have an abortion, but allowed states to impose some restrictions as the fetus matures to the point of viability. 12 states have laws protecting the right to abortion prior to viability, essentially independently affirming Roe v. Wade; 3 other states go farther to guarantee the absolute right to abortion. 22 states have laws passed which are more restrictive than Roe allows; they are unconstitutional for now, but some predict that the current conservative-majority Supreme Court may overturn Roe, or carve smaller exceptions to Roe. In such a case, one of these \"trigger\" laws currently on the books could then take effect immediately. Kelsey Piper of Vox predicted this has a 40% of happening: The Supreme Court, now dominated by justices who think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, might overturn it in the next year. More likely, they might technically leave it in place but hollow it out. I consider it pretty likely that they’ll aim to reduce abortion access only a little, and that they won’t overturn Roe or take any larger steps to allow states to pass sweeping abortion bans. [...] In the long run, I expect very few US states to stand by such total bans — they’re overwhelmingly unpopular with the American public, most of whom want abortion available at least under limited circumstances, especially early in a pregnancy. But they’ve made their way onto the books, protected from public scrutiny by the fact that they’re currently unconstitutional, and if the Supreme Court lets them go into effect, millions of Americans will temporarily live under deeply unpopular, extreme anti-abortion laws. I consider this somewhat unlikely — the Supreme Court tends to prefer not to take such strong steps when it can instead advance its aims more gradually by chipping away, rather than overturning, Roe — but still likely enough that it ought to be on everyone’s radar. By 2022, Will at least one abortion ban currently blocked by federal courts go into effect? This question will resolve positively if any of 19 state-level abortion bans become enforcable by ruling of a federal court in 2021. An elligble law will qualify if it is enforcable without amendment or modification for any length of time during 2021; it need not be actually enforced in reality.",

    "id": "M6807",
    "background": "Background Building permits are a key indicator of the health of the US housing market as they provide an estimate of the number of new housing units authorized by the government in any given month. Larger numbers of permits reflect an increase in the total planned investment in the housing market in the months to come, indicating expectations for economic growth and expansion, while lower numbers can signal a potential downturn in the economy. Peaking previously on September 1, 2005, at approximately 2.5 million a month, the Great Recession saw a large drop in the number of building permits issued, to just over 500,000 per month in 2009. However, stabilizing economic health and increased investment in the housing market pushed the number of building permits per month continually upward over the last decade. Despite the economic hardships of the pandemic in 2020, the number of new permits reached 1.881 million in January 2021, the highest level since 2005. What will be the total number of new US building permits issued in April 2021? Resolution Predictions should reflect the total number of new building permits issued (in millions) in total for the month of April. Resolution will be sourced from the US Census Bureau.

    "id": "M6809",
    "background": "Background Durable goods orders is a broad, monthly survey conducted by the US Census Bureau to measure the current level of industrial activity within the US. Focusing more on the supply chain side of the economy than other indicators, the durable goods orders can act as a valuable tool in understanding the earnings of industries such as machinery, technology, manufacturing, and transportation. A higher number is seen as bullish for the economy as supply moves upward to meet consumer demand, while a low number is seen as bearish and can predict an upcoming economic downturn. The durable goods orders can also be indicative of upcoming changes in stock price for companies within these industries as well. Data for this number encompasses over 5,000 independently polled companies across 92 different industries, and is highly volatile due to the high price of the durable goods, which is why several months of data for orders is often used for economic analysis. What will be the percentage change in the number of US durable goods ordered in April 2021?

This may be attributable to the B.1.526 variant, which seems to elude some of the immunity given by both vaccines and having contracted the disease. The New York Times evaluates risk levels in U.S. counties using cases per capita and test positivity rates. Their tracker for New York City assessed the risk in the city as \"extremely high,\" the highest risk level, for the 67 days from December 29 to March 5 inclusive. March 6 was the first day that it instead read \"very high.\" This question serves as a companion question to \"NYC 'low risk' date for COVID\" On what date will the New York Times COVID-19 tracker for New York City assess the risk as \"medium\"? The question resolves with the first date that reads as \"medium risk\" on the New York Times's NYC COVID-19 tracker. Note that the publication of the assessment takes place the following day: for example, the first \"very high risk\" date was March 6, but this was published on March 7. In that case, the question would resolve as March 6, not March 7. The question resolves ambiguously if the Times stops publishing the tracker or eliminates \"medium risk\" as a category before ever assessing the risk as \"medium.\" Fine print",

    "id": "M6874",
    "background": "Context Initial jobless claims reflect the number of people filing for unemployment insurance over the last week. A higher number should be read negatively as higher unemployment reduces the productivity of the economy. Greatly impacted by the spread of COVID-19, the number of initial jobless claims skyrocketed in March but has gradually begun to decrease since then. However, the current level for the beginning of August is over five times the level recorded in December of 2019. January 14th 2021 saw a larger than expected increase in initial jobless claims, causing an uptick in a previously downward trend. As mutations of the virus spread and the pandemic worsens across America, fears concerning the weakening of the labor market are beginning to grow. The level of initial jobless claims is an excellent indicator of the health of the jobs market, and the economy as a whole. Low levels of claims can signal that companies might have a more difficult time hiring workers, and that workers currently employed will need overtime pay or higher compensation as an enticement. Wage inflation can increase interest rates and decrease the price of bonds and stocks in the investment market, which is bad news to investors and is watched carefully by the Federal Reserve.

    "id": "M6877",
    "background": "Context The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is one of the most widely used measures of inflation by investors. Created by analyzing the price of a certain basket of widely used, urban consumer goods over time with relation to a base time, the CPI can show either monthly or yearly price fluctuations. The CPI for specific cities, types of goods, and by wage-earners can also be calculated. Complete CPI data is released monthly by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds. Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable. However, both the full CPI and the core CPI track each other when graphed over the long-run.

When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices. Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today’s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil’s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good. Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices. It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse.

    "id": "M6879",
    "background": "Context Nonfarm payroll employment is a compiled name for goods, construction and manufacturing companies in the US. It does not include farm workers, private household employees, or non-profit organization employees. It is an influential statistic and economic indicator released monthly by the United States Department of Labor as part of a comprehensive report on the state of the labor market. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases preliminary data on the third Friday after the conclusion of the reference week, i.e., the week which includes the 12th of the month, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time; typically this date occurs on the first Friday of the month. Nonfarm payroll is included in the monthly Employment Situation or informally the jobs report and affects the US dollar, the Foreign exchange market, the bond market, and the stock market. You can see historical data for this figure here. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, there has been a major selloff in world financial markets, and more than 22 million Americans lost their jobs in a four-week period during March and April 2020. The unemployment rate, while falling slowly, sat at 6.7% by the end of December. And, by late January, over 400,000 Americans had lost their lives. With the vaccines currently being distributed, more people should be able to return to work as the economy re-opens, raising the labor force and employment rates.

    "question": "What will be the percentage change in the number of US durable goods ordered in May 2021?",
    "id": "M6880",
    "background": "Background Durable goods orders is a broad, monthly survey conducted by the US Census Bureau to measure the current level of industrial activity within the US. Focusing more on the supply chain side of the economy than other indicators, the durable goods orders can act as a valuable tool in understanding the earnings of industries such as machinery, technology, manufacturing, and transportation. A higher number is seen as bullish for the economy as supply moves upward to meet consumer demand, while a low number is seen as bearish and can predict an upcoming economic downturn. The durable goods orders can also be indicative of upcoming changes in stock price for companies within these industries as well. Data for this number encompasses over 5,000 independently polled companies across 92 different industries, and is highly volatile due to the high price of the durable goods, which is why several months of data for orders is often used for economic analysis.

    "question": "What will be the total number of new US building permits issued in May 2021?",
    "id": "M6882",
    "background": "Background Building permits are a key indicator of the health of the US housing market as they provide an estimate of the number of new housing units authorized by the government in any given month. Larger numbers of permits reflect an increase in the total planned investment in the housing market in the months to come, indicating expectations for economic growth and expansion, while lower numbers can signal a potential downturn in the economy. Peaking previously on September 1, 2005, at approximately 2.5 million a month, the Great Recession saw a large drop in the number of building permits issued, to just over 500,000 per month in 2009. However, stabilizing economic health and increased investment in the housing market pushed the number of building permits per month continually upward over the last decade. Despite the economic hardships of the pandemic in 2020, the number of new permits reached 1.881 million in January 2021, the highest level since 2005.

Will this be significantly revised by June to criteria that any vaccinated American passport-holder could pass? Will vaccinated American citizens be allowed to enter Canada for discretionary travel by June 1st, 2021? The question will resolve positively if entrance criteria for American passport holders is no different than what is was in January 2020, with one exception: additional requirement of proof of vaccination. This will be determined by available information on the Canadian government's website, canada.ca.",

    "background": "Related question by @Fee, with many background facts: Troops in Afghanistan on 2021-05-01 In the late 20th century, the United States (acting through Zia al-Haq of Pakistan) provided assistance to a group of Afghanis known then as mujahedeen, who were trying to evict a Soviet occupation force. Some non-Afghanis gravitated to Afghanistan to help the mujahedeen. To coordinate these outsiders, a new organization was formed; its name was Al Qaeda. One of the outsiders, a Saudi engineer named Usama bin Laden (b. 1957), became the network's leader; he & al Qaeda were welcomed to establish a base of operations in Afghanistan after the Soviets left. On September 11, 2001, in an event commonly referred to as 9/11, four terrorist cells totalling 19 men (most of them Saudi) executed a mission for which they had been trained by al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The mission caused significant loss of life in Arlington County, Virginia, NY County, New York, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, as well as large-scale property damage in those locales. Soon after that, on October 7, 2001, the United States began overt military operations in Afghanistan. Those operations expanded to other Asian nations during a 19-year military presence. On May 2, 2011, the U.S. Navy's \"Seal Team Six\" carried out a secret mission in Pakistan during which they killed Usama bin Laden. U.S. forces remained in Afghanistan.. Following various \"troop drawdowns\", the U.S. agreed to leave that country before the 10th anniversary of bin Laden's death; but President Biden decided that some troops would remain there until the 20th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks on civilians in the eastern U.S.. Such timetables are sometimes delayed by factors foreseeable & unforeseeable. This question asks: Will U.S. military troops be in Afghanistan on 2021-10-7? Statements issued by civilian leaders of the U.S. military, or by any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be deemed credible unless contradicted by very persuasive statements from any source familiar with the territory. Resolution of this question will not be affected by the presence in Afghanistan (at any time) of Red Cross, \"blue hats\", or any Private military contractors or \"PMCs\". Similarly, troops guarding the US diplomatic presence and unreported special forces missions will not be counted. 2021-10-7 refers to October 7, 2021.",

    "question": "Will a Tesla car not demonstrate fully autonomous capability before the end of 2021?",
    "id": "M7113",
    "background": "In January of 2021, Elon Musk tweeted: \"Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though.\" Tesla did release earlier this year the beta for what they call Full Self-Driving Capability, which suggests an improvement on the driver assistance system, presumably with less driver input, or even none as Elon Musk suggests in his tweet. However, Elon Musk is known to make bold statements about the capabilities of the cars his company produces, sometimes bordering on bad faith. According to Business Insider, in 2015, he predicted that the company's fully autonomous vehicles would be ready by 2018. In 2016, he said a Tesla would drive itself coast to coast the following year. In early 2019, Musk said he was certain that a Tesla \"will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention - this year.\" Will a Tesla car demonstrate fully autonomous capability before the end of 2021? For the definition of fully autonomous cars, we'll be referencing the \"self driving level 5\", as defined by the SAE International: \"the vehicle performs all driving tasks under all conditions. Zero human attention or interaction is required.\" We will allow cars that need human override in extreme circumstances, but we expect less than one override per car in a typical year. Besides being autonomous, the vehicle will have to perform as well as (or better than) a normal car with an average driver. Elon Musk raised valid concerns about the regulatory environment, which might cause a delay in the adoption of the technology. I believe however that, in the case of a successful development of the required software updates and/or new prototypes, Tesla will provide enough information to the press to allow for the publication of unequivocal articles referencing explicitly the tested unit's compliance with \"self driving level 5\" requirements as defined by the SAE International.

    "background": "There are currently numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the U.S. that are thought to be able to partially evade immunity induced by prior infection and/or vaccination. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that have higher transmissibility, cause more severe disease, or that can evade immunity to some extent have been detected and tracked since late 2020. Of particular concern to public health authorities in Virginia are SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating that are thought to be able to partially evade immunity induced by prior infection and/or vaccination. The U.S. CDC currently defines three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants. For our purposes, variants of concern and variants of high consequence are of particular interest: Variant of concern (VOC): “variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.” As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are five VOCs: B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429. Variant of high consequence (VOHC): “variant of high consequence has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.” As of the most recent CDC update on 27 April, there are no VOHCs. Of the five variants categorized under these categories (all five are VOCs), as of 27 April 2021 there are four that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" (indicating they are able to partially evade immunity induced by infection and vaccination): P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.429. As of 27 April 2021, 8.8% of total available sequences in Virginia are one of these four VOCs: 2.3% B.1.351, 6.0% B.1.427/B.1.429, 0.5% P.1. Will variants of concerns thought to partially escape immunity make up more than 50% of samples sequenced in Virginia on 29 August - 11 September 2021? This question will resolve on the basis of the most recent update of the \"Unweighted Proportions of Variants of Concern and Other Lineages by State or Jurisdiction\" table on the U.S. CDC's \"Variant Proportions\" page.

Likewise, if any of the four variants of concern that are currently classified as causing partial immune escape are removed from being classified as such, they will no longer count toward the total percent figure. 27 July edit: Any additional variants that as of question resolution on 1 October are classified by the CDC as variants of concern that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" will count toward the total percent figure.",

VDH recommends schools use the CDC Indicators for Dynamic School Decision-Making jointly with the Interim Guidance for K-12 School Reopening document to inform decisions about school operations with regard to COVID-19. VDH maintains a School Metrics dashboard to assist school divisions in tracking CDC indicators. VDOE reports school division schedules in the Virginia School Operational Status dashboard. The dashboard includes five categories: In Person: 4+ days of in person instruction for all students. Partial In Person: 4+ days in person for some students (usually the younger grades); hybrid or remote other students All Hybrid: All students with some in person and some remote (none hitting the 4 days/week threshold). Partial Hybrid: Some students hybrid (usually the younger grades; none hitting the 4 days/week threshold), all others fully remote.

Johnson is considered a divisive or controversial figure in UK politics. Supporters have praised him as optimistic, humorous and entertaining, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters. Conversely, his critics have accused him of elitism, cronyism, and prejudice. His actions that are viewed by supporters as pragmatic tend to be viewed by opponents as opportunistic. As of April 2021, Johnson is the subject of a controversy concerning renovation of his official residence in Downing Street, and the British Electoral Commission is to investigate the affair. The spending watchdog said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\". The PM is under growing pressure to declare how refurbishments were paid for after his ex-adviser said there was a plan for donors to \"secretly pay\". Mr Johnson told MPs he had covered the revamp \"personally\", but would not say who had paid the initial bill. As of late April 2021, Johnson's Conservative Party has a comfortable lead in national polling, a strong House of Commons majority, and no general election is required in 2021. Will Boris Johnson be UK Prime Minister in January 2022? This question resolves positively if Boris Johnson is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on January 1 2022. It resolves negatively if this is not the case.",

The city is based on a concept by American economist Paul Romer and is intended to form a quasi-independent city-state with private government and its own fiscal, regulatory, and legal architecture. The city is being developed in a previously unoccupied 58 acre area that has been carved out of Honduras under a legal arrangement called ZEDE (Spanish acronym for Zone for Employment and Economic Development). Under this regulation, other parts of Honduras could be annexed to Próspera in the future as long as the owners of the land are willing to sell it to the city. This land need not be contiguous with the current tract, which could turn Próspera into a network of exclaves within Honduras. The city currently contains only three buildings and has no permanent population. The project seeks to attract both Hondurans escaping poverty and violence and highly mobile international professionals with a package of pro-market, business-friendly, libertarian policies. For an in-depth review of the project, see this post by Scott Alexander. Scott forecasted there was a 30% chance that Próspera would have a population >= 1,000 in 2021. Will Próspera's population in 2021 be larger than 1,000? This question resolves positive if the population (according to credible sources) of Próspera is >= 1000 at any point during 2021.

R. 26.04, subd. 1, on the following grounds: the interests of justice; abuse of discretion that deprived the Defendant of a fair trial; prosecutorial and jury misconduct; errors of law at trial; and a verdict that is contrary to law. Further, Chauvin's attorney filed a motion requesting the court to order a hearing to impeach the verdict, pursuant to Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.03, subd. 20(6) and Schwartz v. Minneapolis Suburban Bus Co., 104 N.W.2d 301 (Minn. 1960), on the grounds that the jury committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated, felt race-based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations, in violation of Mr. Chauvin’s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. The motions can be read here. (PDF) Will a new Derek Chauvin homicide trial be ordered on or before April 20, 2022? This question resolves positively if on or before 20 April 2022, a new trial is ordered for Derek Chauvin on homicide charges connected to the death of George Floyd. The trial need not start on or before this date; but an order granting it must have been given on or before 20 April 2022 for a positive resolution.

    "id": "M7164",
    "background": "Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that have higher transmissibility, cause more severe disease, or that can evade immunity to some extent have been detected and tracked since late 2020. The U.S. CDC currently defines three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants. For our purposes, variants of concern and variants of high consequence are of particular interest: Variant of interest (VOI): “variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.” As of the most recent CDC update on 30 April, there are three VOIs: B.1.526, B.1.525, and P.2. Variant of concern (VOC): “variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.” As of the most recent CDC update on 30 April, there are five VOCs: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.427, and B.1.429. Variant of high consequence (VOHC): “variant of high consequence has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.” As of the most recent CDC update on 30 April, there are no VOHCs. According to the CDC \"SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions\" page, of 30 April there are five of the above variants that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" — these are: P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, B.1.429, and B.1.526. Combined, these variants made up ~19.4% of sequences for the two-week period ending 10 April. These variants are thought to cause reduced neutralization because of evidence from lab studies, which are cited on the CDC page. What will be the % prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants thought to partially escape immunity for the two-week period 23 May - 05 June 2021? This question will resolve on the basis of the first update that shows figures for the two-week period ending 05 June of the \"Weighted Estimates of Proportions of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages\" table on the U.S. CDC's \"Variant Proportions\" page. The percentages of variants that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" will be added up. If between now and 05 June there are additional variants classified by the CDC as variants that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera,\" these will count toward the total percent figure. Likewise, if any of the variants that are currently classified as causing partial immune escape are removed from being classified as such, they will no longer count toward the total percent figure.",

    "question": "What will be the price of gas on Ethereum one week after EIP-1559?",
    "id": "M7177",
    "background": "Ethereum is the second largest blockchain in market capitalization of its base currency (ETH), and the first and largest Turing-complete blockchain. Users pay fees so that nodes will include their transactions in the chain. The fee attached to an Ethereum transaction is usually called \"gas\". Currently, the price of gas is determined via auction. When users submit transactions to the blockchain they indicate how much they're willing to pay for their transaction to be included in the next block. Nodes then sort transactions selfishly to maximize their profit. This leads to fee volatility and results in long delays for transactions submitted with low bids, among other issues. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 seeks to address this by introducing new pricing mechanism. With EIP-1559, a base fee is calculated dynamically as a function of network congestion. Crucially, this base fee is \"burned\" i.e. forever removed from the ETH supply. On top of this base fee, users can add a priority fee that works similarly to current fees. The effect this will have on gas price remains unclear, with Ethereum core developers opining that it will have no overall impact. EIP-1559 is scheduled to launch as part of the London upgrade on 2021/07/14. What will be the price of gas on Ethereum one week after EIP-1559? This question will resolve as the (daily) average price of gas, in gwei, one week after EIP-1559 is successfully deployed. What constitutes a successful deployment is defined in the fine print. Data will be pulled from YCharts or, if that source was unavailable, from Etherscan. If no successful deployment of EIP-1559 happens before the end of 2021, this question resolves ambiguous.

Larger numbers of permits reflect an increase in the total planned investment in the housing market in the months to come, indicating expectations for economic growth and expansion, while lower numbers can signal a potential downturn in the economy. Peaking previously on September 1, 2005, at approximately 2.5 million a month, the Great Recession saw a large drop in the number of building permits issued, to just over 500,000 per month in 2009. However, stabilizing economic health and increased investment in the housing market pushed the number of building permits per month continually upward over the last decade.

    "id": "M7179",
    "background": "The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is a key economic indicator that helps predict the future movements in the economy by illustrating the average US consumer’s confidence level. Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy. “Respondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value. The resulting values are added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.” Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings. However, the opposite is true when consumers feel less confident. When more money flows through the economy, there is less worry for recession, and the index value increases.

Focusing more on the supply chain side of the economy than other indicators, the durable goods orders can act as a valuable tool in understanding the earnings of industries such as machinery, technology, manufacturing, and transportation. A higher number is seen as bullish for the economy as supply moves upward to meet consumer demand, while a low number is seen as bearish and can predict an upcoming economic downturn. The durable goods orders can also be indicative of upcoming changes in stock price for companies within these industries as well.

    "question": "What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in June 2021?",
    "id": "M7182",
    "background": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad. Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices. Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today’s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil’s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good. Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices. It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse. What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in June 2021? This question will resolve as the monthly average in tens of millions of barrels for the change in commercial crude oil inventories for the month of June as reported through the EIA in their Weekly Petroleum Status Report.

Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds. Considered a cost-of-living index, however components like food and energy consumption can fluctuate widely by month, so monitoring the core CPI (without including either of these factors) is often more stable.

The Conservative Party won 19,069 votes, or 36% of the total. Labour won the seat with a majority of 3,525, or 6.7%. Will the UK Conservative Party win the 2021 Batley and Spen by-election? This question resolves positively if the Conservative and Unionist Party candidate wins the by-election held to fill the vacancy left by Tracy Brabin's resignation. Fine print",

    "question": "How much interest will the 2021 US Government report on UAPs generate?",
    "id": "M7191",
    "background": "In 1945, after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the true nature of the secret Manhattan Project became revealed to the public, What formerly had been privy to a select few now became the object of intense public curiosity and scrutiny. Manhattan Project officials, however, had no intent to release what they viewed as essential military secrets. To both allay inordinate inquisitiveness and satisfy the legitimate public need to know, officials in early 1944 began a carefully designed public relations program in anticipation of when they would have to announce the news to the world. [...] Sixteen hours after the bombing, the White House released a statement by President Harry S. Truman, who was en route from the Potsdam Conference aboard the U.S.S. Augusta. \"It is an atomic bomb,\" Truman announced, \"harnessing... the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.\" In 2021 a report on UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) is scheduled to be released to the public by the US Government on June 1st. A measure of media and public interest into this report, at the time of the publication, may serve as a guidepost for understanding how important this development is. Will the report be a landmark development in the history of science — as was the revelation of atomic bombs in 1945 — or will it fade from the news cycle within days? How much interest will the 2021 US Government report on UAPs generate? Two weeks after the initial public information about the UAP report is revealed (whether or not it is released on the scheduled date of June 1st, and whether or not the full report is released to the public), the following indicators will be added together to form an \"index\" representing the amount of public interest in the UAP report. This index will be used for resolution. One point if the report is mentioned in the English Wikipedia's section \"In the news\" on its main page. One point if the Google Trends interest in the topic of UFOs reaches at least 300% any prior level in the last 12 months, as determined using the current widget showing the last 12 months of interest on Google Trends. One point if a Reddit post regarding UAPs receives at least 150 thousand net upvotes, as measured by browsing /r/all and viewing the top posts of the last month. One point if President Biden gives a public speech of any kind, whose primary purpose is to provide information regarding UAP revelations. One more point if, in Biden's speech, he says the terms \"alien\" or \"extraterrestrial\" (including their plural). One point if #UFO obtains a value of at least 500 on trendsmap during any period. One point if Elon Musk tweets anything about UAPs. One point if anything about UAPs appears on NASA's blog. One point if the S&P 500 closing price falls or rises at least 500 points compared to its pre-report value, for reasons widely considered to be related to the UAP report. One point times the number of articles appearing in Fox News' UFO category during the two week period, divided by 25, with a maximum value of 1. (In other words, take min(1, articles/25)). Each part of the index must happen during the two week period after the report is released. Fine print",

Pedro Castillo is a teacher and trade unionist from a rural part of Peru. He is a leader of the leftist Free Peru party. Several Free Peru party members have had ties to the Shining Path (a once very powerful leftist guerilla movement with a terrible human rights record). In the first round, Castillo was initially polling at only 3% but surprised everyone when his support surged to win the first round with 19%. Keiko Fujimori is the daughter of dictator Alberto Fujimori and former first-lady. She is the leader of the right-wing Popular Force party which came in second place with 13% on the first round. If elected, she might pardon her father who currently is incarcerated in a Peruvian jail. Fujimori, and many members of her party, are currently facing corruption charges. Peru is suffering from the devastating impact of the coronavirus on peoples' health and on the economy. This combined with the high levels of political corruption may have caused people to vote for candidates who are polar opposites on the political spectrum.

They recently announced that they were heading back into the studio to record their next album, which is arguably their tenth album after these previous releases: Metalizer (2002, released 2007) Primo Victoria (2005) Attero Dominatus (2006) The Art of War (2008) Coat of Arms (2010) Carolus Rex (2012) Heroes (2014) The Last Stand (2016) The Great War (2019) When will Sabaton release their tenth album? This resolves to the date that Sabaton's next new album is released; a new album is any album that contains at least 7 songs originally performed by Sabaton that were not released prior to 2021. This means that the song Livgardet / The Royal Guard would count if it is also on the album, since it was released as a single in 2021, but the song Defense of Moscow would not, since it is a cover of a song originally performed by Radio Tapok.",

    "id": "M7212",
    "background": "Context Initial jobless claims reflect the number of people filing for unemployment insurance over the last week. A higher number should be read negatively as higher unemployment reduces the productivity of the economy. The level of initial jobless claims is an excellent indicator of the health of the jobs market, and the economy as a whole. Low levels of claims can signal that companies might have a more difficult time hiring workers, and that workers currently employed will need overtime pay or higher compensation as an enticement. Wage inflation can increase interest rates and decrease the price of bonds and stocks in the investment market, which is bad news to investors and is watched carefully by the Federal Reserve. Related questions: Initial Jobless Claims March 2021 Initial Jobless Claims April 2021 Additional forecasts and historical data can be found through these sources: FXstreet Investing.com Trading Economics MQL5 Markets Insider What will be the 4-week average of initial jobless claims filed in May 2021?

The aim of these six questions is to put this conflict in the context of past conflicts between Israel and Palestine, as well as to help us understand the trajectory of the conflict. Sources for live-updates: The Times of Israel Al Jazeera Question For this question, you are asked to forecast: Will more than 10,000 rockets, mortars, and missiles be fired from Palestine at Israel in 2021? Implications: (A) Unless dramatic increase in fire rate, greatly extended fighting, (B) More foreign funding of Hamas than likely expected Read our forecast with the significant signals and constraints we've identified, find more background information, and listen to our podcast on this question at globalguessing.com. Israel-Palestine Crisis 2021 Forecasting Series Will more than 400 Palestinians in 2021 be killed by the IDF? Will more than 1,000 Palestinians in 2021 be killed by the IDF?

    "question": "Will Elizabeth Holmes not be convicted on fraud charges related to Theranos before 2023?",
    "id": "M7291",
    "background": "Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. According to the indictment, the charges stem from allegations that Holmes and Balwani engaged in a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both schemes involved efforts to promote Theranos, a company founded by Holmes and based in Palo Alto, California. Theranos was a private health care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionize medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood, and interpreting the resulting patient data. Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos’s blood testing laboratory services, even though, according to the government, the defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests. It is further alleged that the tests performed on Theranos technology were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results. Holmes denies the charges and is presumed to be innocent. Theranos raised more than $700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. By 2015, Forbes had named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America. A turning point came later in 2015 when medical research professors John Ioannidis and Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. Holmes is currently awaiting trial. The jury selection process will begin soon, subject to further legal wrangling, with the trial expected to commence on August 31. However, the trial has been delayed a number of times, and it may be delayed again. According to a jury questionnaire proposed by Holmes' lawyers, the trial is expected to last 13 weeks, or possibly longer. Will Elizabeth Holmes be convicted on fraud charges related to Theranos before 2023? This question resolves positively if before 1 January 2023, Elizabeth Holmes is convicted of any charge of fraud, or conspiracy to commit fraud, in connection with Theranos. A conviction on any other charges will not count towards resolution. If Holmes is not convicted on fraud charges connected to Theranos before 1 January 2023, this question resolves negatively. If Holmes' trial ends without a verdict, that will not automatically cause negative resolution, as it is possible that Holmes could be convicted in a subsequent retrial before 1 January 2023. If this question is still open on the date that a verdict is rendered, a plea leading to conviction is entered, or the charges against Holmes are dismissed, the question should resolve retroactively to the time and date such an event is announced by the court, or by representatives of two opposing parties to the case.",

The JWST's construction was completed in late 2016, after which its extensive testing phase began. In March 2018, NASA further delayed the launch after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment. Launch was delayed again in June 2018 following recommendations from an independent review board. Work on integration and testing of the telescope was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding further delays. Work has resumed, but NASA announced that the launch date has once again been delayed to October 31, 2021. Now, NASA had been working toward an October 31st launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's having to delay the science observatory's trip into space once again. Thankfully, the launch might take place just a few weeks later, in November or early December. A rescheduled date is unlikely to be confirmed until later this summer or perhaps in the fall. XKCD provided an extrapolated launch date of around 2026, given previous launch delays. When will the James Webb telescope be launched? This question resolves on the date during which the first component of the James Webb telescope is first launched upwards towards (whether or not the telescope functions as intended, or indeed even lasts more than one second after launch without blowing up), as described by reliable media.",

    "id": "M7308",
    "background": "Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that have higher transmissibility, cause more severe disease, or that can evade immunity to some extent have been detected and tracked since late 2020. The U.S. CDC currently defines three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants. For our purposes, variants of concern and variants of high consequence are of particular interest: Variant of interest (VOI): “variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.” As of the most recent CDC update on 01 June, there are eight VOIs: B.1.525, B.1.526, B.1.526.1, B.1.617, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.617.3, and P.2. Variant of concern (VOC): “variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.” As of the most recent CDC update on 01 June, there are five VOCs: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.427, and B.1.429. Variant of high consequence (VOHC): “variant of high consequence has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.” As of the most recent CDC update on 01 June, there are no VOHCs. As of 01 June, variants that cause \"reduced neutralization\" by convalescent and/or post-vaccination sera according to the CDC are P.1, B.1.351, B.1.427, B.1.429, B.1.526, B.1.617, P.2. Combined, these variants made up ~15.7% of sequences for the two-week period ending 8 May. These variants are thought to cause reduced neutralization because of evidence from lab studies, which are cited on the CDC page. What will be the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants thought to partially escape immunity for the two-week period 20 June - 03 July 2021? This question will resolve on the basis of the first update that shows figures for the two-week period ending 03 July of the \"Weighted Estimates of Proportions of SARS-CoV-2 Lineages\" table on the U.S. CDC's \"Variant Proportions\" page. The percentages of variants that cause \"reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera\" will be added up. If between now and 03 July there are additional variants classified by the CDC as variants that cause \"reduced neutralization\" by convalescent and/or post-vaccination sera, these will count toward the total percent figure. Likewise, if any of the variants that are currently classified as causing partial immune escape are removed from being classified as such, they will no longer count toward the total percent figure.",

Such a tax would aim to solve the problem of large companies that generate huge revenues but pay very little tax because they set up offices for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions. The solution the OECD is working on would force a minimum global level of tax on all corporate revenues, no matter where a company chooses to set up its headquarters for tax purposes.\" The United States originally proposed a minimum tax level of 21% in April, which was recently lowered to 15%, garnering \"broad support\" from in Europe with the exception of the UK. An agreement on the implementation of a global corporate tax law is set to occur at the G20 Conference in July 2021. If a minimum corporate tax law is approved at the G20 Conference in July, what will be the minimum corporate tax level applied to all G20 countries? This question resolves as the approved minimum corporate tax level that will be applied to all G20 countries in principle by the OECD through the decision making process at the G20 Conference this July 2021. If no minimum corporate tax law is approved at either the G7 Conference in June or in the G20 Conference in July, then this question resolves ambiguously. If a minimum corporate tax law is approved at either conference, but no specific numbers are released to the press or decided on by the G20 leaders, then the question will resolve ambiguously. If some countries hold out and do not agree to the minimum corporate tax law, but a majority of the G20 countries (>10) agree to approve a certain level of corporate tax, then the question will resolve as that level of tax. If only a minority (<10) approve the minimum corporate tax law, then the question will resolve ambiguously.",

Understanding the CPI is vitally important not only for investors, but also for people saving for retirement, or taking out loans on a mortgage or education. If the CPI rises, showing a positive percent increase in inflation, goods will become more expensive in the future, thereby decreasing the purchasing power of savings and increasing the amount necessary to pay back on loans of all kinds.

    "id": "M7351",
    "background": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad. Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices. Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today’s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil’s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good. Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices. It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse. What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in July 2021? This question will resolve as the monthly average for the change in commercial crude oil inventories for the month of June in millions of barrels as reported through the EIA in their Weekly Petroleum Status Report.

The resulting values are added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.” Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings. However, the opposite is true when consumers feel less confident. When more money flows through the economy, there is less worry for recession, and the index value increases.

    "question": "What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in August 2021?",
    "id": "M7361",
    "background": "The EIA, or Energy Information Administration, records the inventories of US and foreign produced petroleum, these inventory levels directly affect the price of petroleum sold in the United States and abroad. Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices. Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today’s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil’s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good. Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices. It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse. What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in August 2021? This question will resolve as the monthly average for the change in commercial crude oil inventories for the month of August in millions of barrels as reported through the EIA in their Weekly Petroleum Status Report. Historical data on a weekly basis can be found here. This will include the reporting dates for 4-August, 11-August, 18-August, 25-August. For reference, a previous report released on May 5 shows the weekly change in commercial crude oil inventories at -8M barrels.",

Just like any other good or service, petroleum prices are determined by the supply and demand forces of the energy market. When the market is expanding and the economy is characterized by positive growth, inventories decrease due to high levels of demand, which causes a supply shortage, thereby jacking up prices. In contrast, when the market is contracting and the economy is slowing, there is an excess of supply as inventories build and demand drops, decreasing prices. Crude oil, gas, and petroleum remain linchpins of today’s economy, and contribute heavily to global employment, manufacturing, and transportation amongst other things. Because of its involvement in a variety of sectors and industries across the globe, fluctuations in price can heavily impact the direction and growth of any one, or many, economies. Changes in the price of these goods cannot impact inflation, as inflation represents the rise in price of all goods, which would keep oil’s relative price to other goods the same. However, fluctuations in petroleum pricing can and do impact the PPF (production possibility frontier) for both itself and for other goods, which can create an effect which resembles short term changes in inflation. But here the cause for this effect stems from a change in the entire production capabilities of the economy, and not from the simple change in price from a single good. Because of this, we can observe trends in changes of consumer prices. As the price of oil falls, consumer prices tend to moderate as the costs of production fall for the economy. As the price of oil increases, the cost of production for a variety of goods increases as well, raising consumer prices. It is obvious that generating an understanding of oil production levels on a frequent basis is paramount to anticipating market trends and potential expansion or collapse. What will be the EIA crude oil stock change for commercial crude oil inventories in September 2021? This question will resolve as the monthly average for the change in commercial crude oil inventories for the month of September in millions of barrels as reported through the EIA in their Weekly Petroleum Status Report. Historical data on a weekly basis can be found here. This will include the reporting dates for 8-September, 15-September, 22-September, 29-September. For reference, a previous report released on May 5 shows the weekly change in commercial crude oil inventories at -8M barrels.",

    "question": "What will be the preliminary value of the US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index in September 2021?",
    "id": "M7372",
    "background": "The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is a key economic indicator that helps predict the future movements in the economy by illustrating the average US consumer’s confidence level. Predominantly helpful for retailers, economists, and investors, data for this indicator is collected through telephone surveys every month to a random cross section of US consumers across the country. Consisting of 60% new recipients, and 40% repeat recipients from previous surveys, the survey attempts to accurately measure and portray shifts in consumer sentiment and confidence in the economy. “Respondents are polled to express their opinion on the following questions: Whether their families' financial conditions have become better or worse than a year ago; Whether respondents expect their families' financial conditions to become better or worse a year from now; Whether business conditions in the next 12 months will become better or worse; How conditions in the country may change in the next five years - whether respondents expect stability or growth of unemployment or depression; Whether it is a good time to purchase large household items and make other large purchases (such as to buy a house, a car, etc.). Answers to these questions are calculated as follows: the percentage of negative values is subtracted from positive ones, and 100 is added to the resulting value. The resulting values are added up and divided by 6.7558 (the benchmark value), after which 2 (the correction constant for the sample composition) is added to the resulting figure.” Consumers who feel more confident about the future of the economy are more likely to increase their demand and purchasing habits, and pull money out of savings. However, the opposite is true when consumers feel less confident. When more money flows through the economy, there is less worry for recession, and the index value increases.

    "question": "When will the U.S. lift its Presidential Proclamation restricting travel from the U.K.?",
    "id": "M7443",
    "background": "On 25 January 2021 President Biden signed a proclamation continuing the suspension of entry of certain travellers from the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Brazil, and expanding restrictions to include travellers from South Africa. The ban prohibits foreign nationals from entering the United States if they have been physically present in the U.K. within 14 days before their attempted entry. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, certain family members and foreign diplomats are exempt. On 8 June 2021, a White House official indicated that it would be forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the U.K. to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions. When will the U.S. lift its Presidential Proclamation restricting travel from the U.K.? The issuance of an official declaration from the White House which indicates that the restrictions on travel from the U.K. as codified in the Presidential Proclamation no longer apply will be considered for resolution. Key resolution details: The resolution date will be the date the restrictions are lifted, not the date the issuance is made. If the proclamation remains in place but exemptions are added such that >50% of the U.K. population are exempt at the time of the issuance (e.g. a vaccine passport), this will trigger a positive resolution. This question does not consider whether the U.K. will allow travel from the U.S. (e.g. if the U.K. government puts the US on its ‘green list’). If the U.S. does not lift the suspension of travel from the U.K. before 2022, then this resolves as “> Dec 31, 2021.”",

    "question": "Will NASA not issue a second fully-funded award for its Human Landing System contract before 2022?",
    "id": "M7448",
    "background": "NASA recently awarded SpaceX $2.9B as the sole winner of its Human Landing System competition to bring astronauts back to the moon. It had been expected that NASA would issue two awards, due to its previous statements that competition and redundancy were \"extremely important principles\" for the program, and so only having one was widely seen as surprising. In its source selection statement [pdf], NASA stressed that the selection of a single provider was due entirely to the fact that the HLS program was underfunded, to the point where they could only award the cheapest bid from SpaceX after negotiating with them to change the funding schedule. Later information releases revealed that SpaceX had bid $2.9B, Blue Origin $5.9B, and Dynetics approximately $8.5B. There have been several developments since then which have raised the possibility of NASA revisiting this contract and awarding two providers as it had originally planned: Blue Origin and Dynetics quickly filed protests on what they claim to be an unfair award selection, and NASA issued a stop-work order to SpaceX until the Government Accountability Office reviewed the protests. The GAO denied these protest on July 30, saying that NASA acted legally in awarding only a single company. The version of S. 1260 The U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Act which the Senate passed on June 8 includes in it language which directs NASA to select a second HLS provider, while protecting SpaceX's current award. It would have to do this within 60 days from the current list of bids, which means either Blue Origin or Dynetics would be selected. However, this directive is an authorization, not an appropriation, meaning that it does not provide funding for this mandate. Additionally, it appears that there may be some resistance to this in the House, and the bill's ultimate future is unknown. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson is pushing to fund HLS with a total of $10B through the \"infrastructure bill\" which Congress is currently debating. On July 26, Jeff Bezos offered to waive the first $2 billion in costs if NASA chose Blue Origin as a second HLS lander system. Will NASA issue a second fully-funded award for its Human Landing System contract before 2022? This question will resolve positively if before 1 January 2022, NASA awards a fully funded second HLS contract to a provider other than SpaceX. This question will resolve negatively otherwise.

This strategy has been remarkably successful, with the country only experiencing 37 deaths from covid-19, though spread among foreign workers who tend to be relatively young have pushed the number of cases to over 60,000. Among the countries that have largely kept covid-19 at bay, Singapore also has one of the fastest vaccination programmes, with 54% fully vaccinated and 73% vaccinated with at least one shot as of 30 July 2021. As such, the government has expressed a goal to begin cautiously resuming international travel in September. If this works out, Singapore would be one of the first 'covid-zero' countries to reopen to the world. On the other hand, Singapore is currently dealing with renewed restrictions owing to a renewed surge of cases from the Delta variant. This question is based on another similar question about New Zealand that can be found here. When will Singapore reopen for quarantine-free international travel? This question will resolve on the first day that all of the following criteria are met: Singapore no longer requires non-citizens/residents from the majority of countries to apply for Safe Travel lanes or other mechanisms that place restrictions on the purpose of travel, excluding the lanes that do not have such restrictions such as the Air Travel Pass or Air Travel Bubble. Singapore no longer requires arrivals from the majority of (UN-recognized) countries to quarantine upon arrival (either home quarantine or hotel quarantine) for more than 48 hours. A short quarantine (≤48 hours) while waiting for a covid-19 test result meets this criteria. Fine print",

    "background": "There are currently three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA, and all three are currently being administered in Virginia: Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen. As of 30 July 2021, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is authorized for those 12 years of age and older, Moderna for 18 years of age and older, and Janssen for those 18 years and older. There are currently no vaccines authorized for use in children under 12. Pfizer and Moderna are currently running trials for children under 12. According to a 26 July report by the New York Times, both Pfizer and Moderna have recently been asked by the FDA to expand the size of their trials for children ages 5 to 11. In its 28 July quarterly report, Pfizer said it expects to “have the safety and immunogenicity data that could potentially support an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in children ages 5 to 11 years old, if such an EUA is deemed necessary, by the end of September. The full dataset from this study, which will be required to support [full BLA approval] licensure in this age group, is expected by the end of 2021.” According to the 26 July NYT report, Moderna expects “to seek emergency authorization late this year or early next year.” When will a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA for children under 12 years old? This question resolves on the basis of a press announcement by the FDA stating that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been authorized for at least some children who are under 12 years of age. If this does not occur before 31 July 2022, then this resolves as > 31 July 2022. See this similar recently closed question.",

    "question": "When will a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine receive full BLA approval by the U.S. FDA?",
    "id": "M7612",
    "background": "There are currently three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) in the U.S.: the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the two-dose Moderna vaccine, and the single-dose Janssen vaccine. As of 30 July 2021, no SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are fully approved under Biologics Use Authorizations (BLA). According to Harvard’s Petrie-Flom Center, an EUA differs from BLA in the following way: an EUA is “an authorization to distribute an otherwise unapproved product (or an approved product for an unapproved use) during an emergency formally declared by the Secretary of Health & Human Services,” while a BLA is “FDA’s standard ‘full approval’ mechanism for biological products, including therapeutics and vaccines. A company seeking a BLA for its product must demonstrate that the product is ‘safe, pure, and potent,’ which generally means completing robust, well-controlled clinical trials.” Both Pfizer and Moderna have submitted applications to the FDA for full BLA approval — Pfizer submitted its application on 7 May 2021 and Moderna did so on 1 June 2021. The FDA says it makes a decision on full approval within 6 months of application submission. On 30 July, STAT News reported that “the Food and Drug Administration center that reviews vaccines is planning to deprioritize some of its existing work, like meetings with drug sponsors and plant inspections, in an effort to accelerate its review of Pfizer’s application for the formal approval of its Covid-19 vaccinea senior agency official told STAT … Now, the senior agency official said, the agency will initiate a ‘sprint.’” When will a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine receive full BLA approval by the U.S. FDA? Resolution will be determined by the date of the first FDA press release announcing the full BLA approval of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. If this does not occur before 31 January 2022, then this resolves as > 31 January 2022.",

    "background": "It remains unclear when public health agencies in the U.S. might recommend a SARS-CoV-2 booster dose for at least some vulnerable groups of fully vaccinated Americans (e.g.,immunocompromised groups or adults over 65 years old). There are currently three vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S.: the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the two-dose Moderna vaccine, and the single-dose Janssen vaccine. On 8 July 2021 Pfizer and BioNTech released a statement saying they “believe that a third dose may be beneficial to maintain the highest levels of protection” — they propose that this third dose would either be another dose of the original BNT162b2 vaccine or an updated version that targets the Delta variant’s spike protein. Later on 8 July 2021, the U.S. CDC and FDA issued a joint statement saying “Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time.” In its 28 July 2021 second quarter results, Pfizer states that “newly disclosed data demonstrates that a third dose [of the original BNT162b2 vaccine] elicits neutralizing titers against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant that are more than five times higher in younger people and more than 11 times higher in older people than after two doses.” Moderna co-founder Derrick Rossi has also suggested that a booster will “almost certainly” be needed. There also remains ongoing discussion as to whether recipients of the single-dose Janssen vaccine will need a second dose to serve as a booster. When will the U.S. CDC recommend that at least some fully vaccinated Americans receive a booster dose? This resolves as the date when the U.S. CDC recommends that at least some fully vaccinated Americans receive a booster dose against COVID-19 — meaning a third dose for recipients of Pfizer or Moderna, or a second dose for recipients of Janssen. This can be any group of fully vaccinated Americans — some potential such groups might be immunocompromised people or those over a certain age (e.g., 65).

The 2020-2021 flu season in the United States is the mildest since at least 2009-2010, which is thought to be the result of widespread physical distancing targeted at COVID-19. This has also been the case in Virginia: the percent ILI for 2020-2021 is also the lowest since at least 2009-2010 — see the “ILI” tab here. The peak percent ILI in Virginia during 2020-2021 was 1.8% in epidemiological week one.

An independent investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James was announced on 28 February 2021. It concluded on 3 August 2021 and found the following: We...conclude that the Governor engaged in conduct constituting sexual harassment under federal and New York State law. Specifically, we find that the Governor sexually harassed a number of current and former New York State employees by, among other things, engaging in unwelcome and nonconsensual touching, as well as making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women. Our investigation revealed that the Governor’s sexually harassing behavior was not limited to members of his own staff, but extended to other State employees, including a State Trooper on his protective detail and members of the public. We also conclude that the Executive Chamber’s culture—one filled with fear and intimidation, while at the same time normalizing the Governor’s frequent flirtations and gender-based comments—contributed to the conditions that allowed the sexual harassment to occur and persist. That culture also influenced the improper and inadequate ways in which the Executive Chamber has responded to allegations of harassment. Following the release of the report, multiple prominent Democrats called on Cuomo to resign, but at a press conference on 3 August Cuomo appeared to decline to resign.

These military assets have proven to be most effective at keeping the Taliban from seizing cities. These units are being ground down by continual fighting. By attacking multiple cities at the same time, the Taliban is forcing the Afghan military to disperse its forces and water down its combat power. Will the Taliban capture downtown Kandahar before the start of Ramadan?

On the one hand, there has been continued progress in vaccine uptake and vaccines are very effective in preventing cases from progressing into hospitalizations. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the delta variant causes more severe disease — potentially leading to more hospitalizations, particularly among unvaccinated people. The case-to-hospitalization rate here is calculated by dividing the total number of cases that are reported over a 7-day period from the total number of hospitalizations that are reported over a 7-day period eight days later. For example: the total number of new confirmed+probable COVID-19 cases between 1 June and 7 June (inclusive) was 1,449, and the total number of new confirmed+probable hospitalizations reported eight days later between 9 June and 15 June was 65. This gives a case-to-hospitalization rate of ~4.5% (65/1449 * 100). What will be the case-to-hospitalization rate in Virginia on 21 August? This will resolve on the basis of the total number of confirmed+probable cases by date of symptom onset reported between 15 and 21 August (inclusive) divided from the total number of confirmed+probable hospitalizations by date of hospital admission reported between 23 August and 29 August (inclusive).

The German electoral system sets the size of the Bundestag (national parliament) to at least 598 members. Due to the peculiarities of the voting system, especially the split between first vote (first past the post) and second vote (proportional representation), the 5% electoral threshold and split votes resulting in excess mandates, the size of the next Bundestag is to be projected to have up to 1000 members (link in German, translation below) Next Bundestag could have more than 1,000 deputies Since the 2017 election, the Bundestag has had 709 members - more than ever before. But even this number could be significantly exceeded after the vote in September. Berlin (dpa) - The next Bundestag could be a good 1000 MPs strong, according to calculations by electoral law expert Robert Vehrkamp. \"The range of plausibly possible Bundestag sizes runs from about 650 to more than 1,000, and we can't rule that out,\" the Bertelsmann Stiftung expert told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin. He is also a member of the commission set up by the Bundestag to reform electoral law and modernize parliamentary work. The standard size of the Bundestag is 598 seats. Since the 2017 election, it has 709 deputies - more than ever before. Although the CDU/CSU and SPD pushed through an amendment to the electoral law last October, experts believe that this will hardly lead to the hoped-for reduction in the size of parliament. […] According to Vehrkamp's presentation, it is not possible to make an accurate prediction about the size of the next Bundestag. \"What is often overlooked in the discussion: It depends not only on the second vote result. It depends at least as much on vote splitting how many overhang mandates there will be. And splitting behavior is even more incalculable than the allocation of second votes.\" For example, the Greens could get about twice as many second votes as in the 2017 election. \"But we don't know what the splitting behavior of Green voters will look like then.\" If about 20 percent of them were to give their first vote to the CDU/CSU - for old ties, for example - that would have \"an enormous leverage effect,\" Vehrkamp said. \"Then, depending on the scenario, you're quickly at 880, 950 or, in extreme cases, even over 1,000 mandates. It doesn't have to happen that way, but it is possible. The current electoral law is a real game of vabanques with regard to the size of the Bundestag.\" Vehrkamp calculated the size of the Bundestag from the ARD \"Deutschlandtrend\" of August 5 (CDU/CSU: 27 percent, Greens: 19, SPD: 18, FDP: 12, AfD: 10, Left: 6) with three different splitting scenarios. Depending on the scenario, it comes to 695, 851 or 978 deputies. […] How many members will the next Bundestag have? The question will resolve with the number of members listed on the website of the German Bundestag following the final results of the September 26, 2021 federal elections. If no Bundestag is formed following the elections, the question will resolve ambiguously.",

    "id": "M7751",
    "background": "There is uncertainty as to how the case-to-hospitalization rate might evolve as the delta-driven wave in Virginia progresses. On the one hand, there has been continued progress in vaccine uptake and vaccines are very effective in preventing cases from progressing into hospitalizations. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the delta variant causes more severe disease — potentially leading to more hospitalizations, particularly among unvaccinated people. The case-to-hospitalization rate here is calculated by dividing the total number of cases that are reported over a 7-day period from the total number of hospitalizations that are reported over a 7-day period eight days later. For example: the total number of new confirmed+probable COVID-19 cases between 1 June and 7 June (inclusive) was 1,449, and the total number of new confirmed+probable hospitalizations reported eight days later between 9 June and 15 June was 65. This gives a case-to-hospitalization rate of ~4.5% (65/1449 * 100). What will be the case-to-hospitalization rate in Virginia on 28 August? This will resolve on the basis of the total number of confirmed+probable cases by date of symptom onset reported between 22 and 28 August (inclusive) divided from the total number of confirmed+probable hospitalizations by date of hospital admission reported between 31 August and 6 September (inclusive). Case and hospitalization numbers are taken from the relevant VDH dashboard and will be accessed 13 September. If the case-to-hospitalization rate exceeds 20%, then this resolves as \">20\"",

    "id": "M7788",
    "background": "In August 2021, Australia reached a new peak in daily confirmed new Covid-19 cases, surpassing its previous peak set in August 2020. As of 19 August 2021, Australia's two biggest cities and its capital territory are in lockdown and several other states and regions have recently emerged from their own lockdowns. International travel remains heavily restricted, and the number of travellers allowed into the country has been halved from 6,370 to 3,070 per week. Under current government policy, vaccination rates will determine when international travel restrictions are loosened and when lockdowns become less likely. At the end of July 2021, the Australian National Cabinet announced a 'Phase B' target of 70% of the eligible population fully vaccinated, and a 'Phase C' target of 80%. In Phase C, the government seeks to \"minimise cases without lockdowns\", enact only \"highly targeted lockdowns\", \"abolish caps on returning vaccinated Australians\", \"lift all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians\" and \"allow increased capped entry of student, economic, and humanitarian visa holders\", among other relaxations in restrictions. As of August 19 2021, just over 28% of the eligible population (those aged at least 16) have been fully vaccinated. According to The Guardian, the 80% national target will be reached by the end of November if the the rate of new vaccinations remains fixed at its rate over the past 7 days. However, the experience of other countries has shown that this rate can slow considerably before reaching 80% of the adult population. For a particular state or territory to enter 'Phase C', the 80% target must be reached in that state or territory as well as in the country as a whole. This question therefore asks about when target will be reached in Australia as a whole as well as in at least half of its states and territories. When will Australia reach its 80% (of 16+ population) Covid-19 vaccination target? For the predicted event to occur, both of the following two conditions must be met: At least 80% of the national population aged at least 16 is considered to be fully vaccinated At least 4 out of the 8 states and territories have each individually met the 80% target The Australian Government's Daily Vaccine Rollout Update will be used to determine when this event occurs.

    "question": "What will be the total number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Australia by the end of 2021?",
    "id": "M7927",
    "background": "For much of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia has used border controls, contact tracing, and strict lockdowns to maintain low case numbers. On 1 September 2021, the country had reported a cumulative death toll of 1019. With the latest Delta wave triggering widespread lockdowns, however, the State and Federal governments have switched from an 'elimination' strategy to a 'containment' strategy. Based principally on modelling from the Doherty Institute, the Australian government now supports 'reopening' when 70-80% vaccination targets are reached in the 16+ population. This modelling suggests that Almost 400,000 symptomatic cases could be seen in six months, and between 1,000-2,000 deaths. (ABC) However, the simplifying assumptions of the Doherty Institute modelling have received criticism. In one recent report from the Australia Institute, the authors write: Perhaps most significantly, the Doherty modelling results are based on the assumption that the effectiveness of the Testing Tracing Isolation and Quarantine (TTIQ) system never deteriorates below the level experienced during Melbourne’s second wave infections that saw daily cases top 700 per day. [...] Given that NSW case numbers have already topped 1,000 per day and that the last time the NSW government publicly announced data on unlinked cases more than 800 of their daily cases were unlinked it would seem optimistic in the extreme for Scott Morrison to continue to base his national plan on the assumption made by Doherty, back in June 2021, that the effectiveness of TTIQ would not fall below that experienced during Melbourne’s second wave. What will be the total number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Australia by the end of 2021? This question resolves according to the cumulative number of deaths reported by Our World in Data for 1 January 2022. To account for possible fluctuations in reporting, this question will resolve according to the OWID data visible when accessed two weeks later (on 2022-01-14).",

Few experts consider that likely to happen, but if it did, it could trigger an economic catastrophe with effects far beyond America's shores. In a letter to members of Congress last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of the damage that would result if the U.S. is unable, even for a short time, to pay its bills. \"A delay that calls into question the federal government's ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets,\" wrote Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve Board. \"At a time when American families, communities, and businesses are still suffering from the effects of the ongoing global pandemic, it would be particularly irresponsible to put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk.\" With that crisis looming, Democrats and Republicans in Washington are battling over who should take responsibility for the politically unpopular task of raising the cap on borrowing, commonly known as the debt limit. Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have vowed that not a single one of them will vote to raise the limit. As of September 20th, Business Insider reports that Mitch McConnell says the GOP will vote for the US to default on its debt: \"We will not support legislation that raises the debt limit,\" McConnell said after Pelosi and Schumer's announcement. \"Democrats do not need our help.\" It is currently unclear when exactly the US would become unable to meet its obligations; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said only that the Treasury will run out of cash “sometime in October.” Will the U.S. default on its debt before 1 November 2021?

    "question": "When will the next German government be formed?",
    "id": "M8058",
    "background": "In German federal elections (most recent: September 26th, 2021) the electorate is electing the German parliament, the Bundestag. Members of the newly formed Bundestag then elect the chancellor with a simple majority vote. As the government is formed by a coalition of multiple parties and negotiating an agreement takes time, there is a time delay between the beginning of the term of the parliament and the government. After the Bundestag elections of September 24th 2017, it took until March 14th, 2018 for Angela Merkel to be reelected and the new government to take office. The most recent federal elections opened multiple pathways to a coalition government, which may impact the speed of forming a new government. For instance, in 2017 one set of coalition talks broke down, and a different coalition needed to be negotiated, leading to an almost three month delay between the election and the establishment of the new governing coalition. On the other hand, party leaders have indicated that forming a new government quickly is desirable and having many options to do so may increase the speed if negotiations are held in parallel. When will the next German government be formed? The question will be resolved to the date that two media sources report that a new German chancellor has been elected and confirmed by checking the page Das Bundeskabinett on the German federal government's website. The question will be closed retroactively one day before the chancellor's election. Fine print",

In the 2021 gubernatorial election in Virginia, Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe currently holds a +3.0 percentage point lead over Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin, according to polling aggregator FiveThiryEight. Polling accuracy has been frequently discussed after most polls underestimated Trump's performance in 2016 and 2020. Some have argued that this is a result of systemic issues that are difficult to address, such as non-response bias. Others have suggested that while it's possible there are systemic issues the bias is unlikely to be consistent over time due to pollsters adjusting after big misses. In the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election, what will be the percentage difference of the vote for McAuliffe over Youngkin? This question will resolve as the percentage of the total vote won by McAuliffe, minus the percentage won by Youngkin. For example, if the vote for McAuliffe is 50% and Youngkin's is 45%, the question will resolve as 5.0. If Youngkin wins 49% versus McAuliffe's 47%, this will resolve as -2.0.",

Competitor Merck’s COVID-19 pill is already under review at the Food and Drug Administration after showing strong initial results, and on Thursday the United Kingdom became the first country to OK it. Pfizer said it will ask the FDA and international regulators to authorize its pill as soon as possible, after independent experts recommended halting the company’s study based on the strength of its results. Once Pfizer applies, the FDA could make a decision within weeks or months. When will Paxlovid be given an EUA from the FDA?

The level of enthusiasm for Rivian stock, and that of EV automakers in general, after Tesla became a trillion-dollar company, has led to some questions about the rationality of its valuation.

Trajectories are: Declining: Sustained decreases following a recent peak Plateau: Steady level with minimal trend up or down Slow Growth: Sustained growth not rapid enough to be considered a Surge In Surge: Currently experiencing sustained rapid and significant growth. As of the 17 November weekly update, 0 districts are described as being “In Surge.” How many of Virginia's 35 local health districts will be described as being \"in surge\" in UVA modeling slides posted 14 January 2022? The question will resolve based on the slide deck UVA Biocomplexity Institute Slides dated 12 January 2022 that are posted on the Virginia Department of Health's COVID-19 Data Insights Blog on 14 January. Occasionally, model runs and posts are delayed. In this case, the nearest following slide deck and post will suffice for resolution, as long as these reference the week ending 16 January 2022 (i.e., the week is not skipped). The question resolves ambiguously if the UVA Biocomplexity stops publishing district trajectories, or eliminates the \"In Surge\" category. However, changes in method or criteria do not affect resolution.",

    "background": "The U.S. CDC currently defines four classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants: variants being monitored, variants of interest, variants of concern, and variants of high consequence. Of these, variant of high consequence (VOHC) is the most severe classification. A VOHC is a variant that “has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.” Moreover, a VOHC might have the following attributes: Demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets Evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease Significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approved therapeutics More severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations To date, no SARS-CoV-2 variant has been classified as a VOHC. Will the U.S. CDC classify a SARS-CoV-2 variant as a variant of high consequence (VOHC) by 1 March 2022? This question will resolve positive if, before 1 March 2022, a SARS-CoV-2 variant is categorized under the “Variant of High Consequence” section on the CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions page.

    "background": "On January 3, 2022, Paul Christiano, of the Alignment Research Center (ARC), posted on LessWrong offering prizes for proposals about eliciting latent knowledge (ELK). The post describes eliciting latent knowledge (ELK) and the proposals being sought as follows: Roughly speaking, the goal of ELK is to incentivize ML models to honestly answer “straightforward” questions where the right answer is unambiguous and known by the model. ELK is currently unsolved in the worst case—for every training strategy we’ve thought of so far, we can describe a case where an ML model trained with that strategy would give unambiguously bad answers to straightforward questions despite knowing better. Situations like this may or may not come up in practice, but nonetheless we are interested in finding a strategy for ELK for which we can’t think of any counterexample. ELK and the existing counterexamples are described in more detail in ARC's December 2021 report Eliciting latent knowledge: How to tell if your eyes deceive you. Here is how the post describes prize awards: To win a prize, you need to specify a training strategy for ELK that handles all of the counterexamples that we’ve described so far, summarized in the section below—i.e. where the breaker would need to specify something new about the test case to cause the strategy to break down. You don’t need to fully solve the problem in the worst case to win a prize, you just need to come up with a strategy that requires a new counterexample. We’ll give a $5,000 prize to any proposal that we think clears this bar. We’ll give a $50,000 prize to a proposal which we haven’t considered and seems sufficiently promising to us or requires a new idea to break. We’ll give intermediate prizes for ideas that we think are promising but we’ve already considered, as well as for proposals that come with novel counterexamples, clarify some other aspect of the problem, or are interesting in other ways. A major purpose of the contest is to provide support for people understanding the problem well enough to start contributing; we aren’t trying to only reward ideas that are new to us. Some retroactive prizes have already been awarded as described below: We’re giving prizes to existing proposals from David Dalrymple ($5k), Ramana Kumar ($3k), John Maxwell ($2k), and Yonadav Shavit ($1k). Will an Eliciting Latent Knowledge prize of $50,000 be awarded? This resolves positively if one or more $50,000 prizes are awarded before June 1, 2022, as a result of submissions to the eliciting latent knowledge proposal contest. The prize must be for work or a submission directly relating to the eliciting latent knowledge research and the relevant LessWrong post. Later contests covering similar AI topics would not count. If for some reason the prize is more than $50,000, but is described by ARC as being intended for the $50,000 category described in the question background, that would satisfy this question.",

[closed] On August 20th 2021, the TSA announced that it would extend the mask mandate on airplanes until March 18th 2022. This deadline could, of course, be extended again. Mask mandates have been widely introduced in response to the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic. In most places, it is mandatory to travel with masks on airplanes, either due to the carrier (airplane operator) or due to government mandates. When will airplane travelers be free from mask mandates in the USA? This question will resolve on the date government mask mandates are removed for ordinary airplane passengers (not e.g. airplane staff), and at least 3 large carriers have no mask mandates. Large carriers are those in the Group III, of which there are 18 currently. Mandates must be removed for all travelers regardless of prior disease history and vaccination status. Any mandate requiring passengers to wear face masks will prevent this question from resolving positively; that is, the mandate may be justified for any reason, not only to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

On January 26th 2022, it was reported by NBC and other media organizations that current Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, considered a liberal on the court, is planning to retire at the end of the court's current term, giving President Biden his first opportunity to nominate a new Justice to the Supreme Court. Will Ketanji Brown Jackson be confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court before 2023? This question resolves positively if Ketanji Brown Jackson is confirmed by the Senate to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States at any time before 00:00 Eastern before January 1, 2023. It resolves negatively if this does not happen.",

    "background": "The gray wolf (canis lupus) is a species of canine and apex predator that is native to Eurasia and North America. Prior to the 20th century, the wolf could be found across most of the United States. Over the past century, wolf populations drastically declined in the contiguous United States due to extermination campaigns and big prey reduction. However, a large population of wolves remained in Canada. In 1973, the gray wolf was added to the list of species protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This protection rendered wolf hunting illegal and mandated that recovery plans be made for the species. Over the next half century, wolf populations in the contiguous United States recovered thanks to natural migration and intentional reintroductions by wildlife agencies. The International Union for Conservation of Nature reclassified the gray wolf from being \"Vulnerable\" in 1994 to \"Least Concern\" in 2004, and in 2020 the gray wolf was delisted from the ESA (the Mexican wolf remains listed). Management of wolf populations was returned to the state agencies, and some states swiftly reestablished hunting programs, which have resulted in the reduction of local wolf populations. Petitions to relist the wolf as threatened or endangered under the ESA recently triggered the USFWS to conduct a year-long status review, which will determine if the species once again requires federal protection. Will the gray wolf be relisted as Threatened or Endangered by the US before 2030?

    "question": "If Russia invades Ukraine in 2022, when will the invasion be acknowledged by Russia or the UN?",
    "id": "M9719",
    "background": "Related Question on Metaculus: Will Russia invade Ukrainian territory in 2022? On February 3, 2022, the Military Times reported that Russia had more than than 136,000 troops massed on the borders of Ukraine. Thomas Harding of the National News suggested that February is a window of opportunity for Russia to invade: One of more intriguing aspects of the near-constant talks concerning Moscow is that military commanders — from Russia and Ukraine — will know that by early March the so-called “Rasputitsa” thaw will arrive. When the winter snow melts the ground will be churned into a quagmire, making passage difficult, even for armoured vehicles. If the Russian tanks are restricted to roads then they will be more vulnerable to Ukraine's US-made Javelin missiles. Speed will be everything if Moscow is to avoid becoming bogged down both physically and politically. In 2014 Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian-held Crimean peninsula, and skirmishes between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have continued in the Donbas region of Ukraine ever since, for which Russia has denied involvement. If Russia invades Ukraine in 2022, when will the invasion be acknowledged by Russia or the UN? This question will resolve on the earliest date in 2022 that either the Russian Federation or any two Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council announce or acknowledge that Russia has invaded Ukraine. These announcements must be describing events which took place (at least in part) during January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023. Areas of Ukraine already occupied (officially or de facto) by Russia as of January 1, 2022, will not trigger resolution. If no such announcement is made by the Russian Federation or members of the UN Security council in 2022, this question will resolve ambiguously. Note that this question resolves for the date of announcements, not on the date of any invasion or military actions; In the case that some invasion occurs in 2022, which is acknowledged publicly in 2023 or later, this question will resolve ambiguously.",

He has extensively supported the \"great replacement\", a conspiracy theory contending that France's native population will be replaced by non-European people.[11] Zemmour was fined for incitement to racial discrimination in 2011 and for incitement of hate against Muslims in 2018, although the latter conviction is pending review before the European Court of Human Rights. He was acquitted six times of similar charges, in 2008, 2014 (twice), 2016, 2017 and 2019. Convictions in 2015 and 2020 were overturned on appeal. Zemmour announced his candidacy for the 2022 French presidential election on 30 November 2021.[12] On 5 December 2021, he launched Reconquête, a new political party.[13] In 2021, a New York Times article described Zemmour's views as \"hard-line... on immigration, Islam's place in France and national identity\",[11] while he self-identifies as Gaullist and Bonapartist.[14] He has advocated for vast changes to France's political system. Will Éric Zemmour win the French presidential election in 2022? If credible media indicate that Éric Zemmour won the French presidential election in 2022, this resolves positively. Otherwise, negatively.",

    "background": "Related Question on Metaculus: Will more than 10,000 people be killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022? In late 2021 and early 2022, several Western governments began publicly expressing concern about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine outside the previously occupied territories in the Donbas and Crimea. The New York Times reported on January 14, 2022: “If Putin invades Ukraine with a major military force, U.S. and NATO military assistance — intelligence, cyber, anti-armor and anti-air weapons, offensive naval missiles — would ratchet up significantly,” said James Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who was the supreme allied commander at NATO. “And if it turned into a Ukrainian insurgency, Putin should realize that after fighting insurgencies ourselves for two decades, we know how to arm, train and energize them.” NBC reported on February 8, 2022: “Even with the disparity of forces, they can move in very fast and quite successfully, but then holding it would be a disaster,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian minister of defense who left office in 2020. Zagorodnyuk said that Ukraine’s military is fully aware of its weaknesses when it comes to a conventional face-to-face war and that plans for an insurgency or guerrilla-style resistance movement led by Ukraine’s military are now the government’s primary strategy — even if the Ministry of Defense has not stated so publicly. Others have been skeptical that a \"serious\" Ukrainian insurgency will take place, for instance on January 26, 2022, Richard Hanania predicted \"Washington is now deluding itself into believing that it can help facilitate an insurgency in Ukraine. This will not happen.\" If Russia invades Ukraine, will +1,000 Russian soldiers be killed by Ukrainian forces in 2022 and 2023? This question will resolve positively if Russia invades Ukraine in the year 2022, and between January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2024, at least 1,000 Russian soldiers are killed by Ukrainian armed forces in Ukraine. For the purposes of this question, we will use the terms as defined in Russian Invasion of Ukraine Before 2023: we will consider Russia to have invaded Ukraine if, between December 11, 2021 and January 1, 2023, either the Russian Federation or any two Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council announce or acknowledge that the Russian Federation has invaded Ukraine. These announcements must be describing events which took place (at least in part) from December 11, 2021 to January 1, 2023. Areas of Ukraine already occupied (officially or de facto) by Russia as of December 11, 2021, will be disregarded. If there is no such invasion of Ukraine by Russia, this question will resolve ambiguously. To determine the count of deaths of Russian soldiers, Metaculus Admins will consider all relevant and credible sources, including adding together counts from separate sources (so long that it can be determined that the sources are referring to different deaths and not double-counting). Deaths may include any members of the Russian armed services, but not Russian civillians. For the purposes of this question, the deaths of members of the Russian armed services must occur within the boundaries of the nation of Ukraine as internationally recognized on January 1, 2014. Therefore attacks conducted within Crimea or the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics will qualify. For the purposes of this question, the Ukrainian armed forces may be made up of members of the Ukrainian armed forces; members of the Ukrainian police, border guards, intelligence agencies, or similar government personnel; militia; or armed or unarmed civilians. Non-Ukrainians working in conjunction with Ukrainians count as long as they are not members of a non-Ukrainian military. As the exact identity of insurgents may not always be clear, any deaths of Russian armed service personnel by violence within Ukrainian borders will be assumed to be from Ukrainian insurgents unless the identity of the attackers can be determined otherwise, or the purpose of the killing is clearly non-political/military.

If there is a report issued at any time in the future that declares a city to have fallen before June 2022, even if that report is released after June 2022, it will count toward resolution. If no such reports are available by June 1, 2025 then this question will resolve negatively. A city is considered fallen if the majority of its raions are under Russian control. To trigger positive resolution, three cities must be under Russian control simultaneously. This period of simultaneity must last at least 48 hours to count.",

    "id": "M10568",
    "background": "On the evening that started this year's Ramadan, the UN announced a surprise breakthrough on the ceasefire in Yemen, which previously appeared unlikely. They now say both sides have agreed to a full two-month ceasefire, beginning the first full day of Ramadan. This will be the first nationwide truce in Yemen in years, a welcome respite for its war-weary population. The death toll of the war in Yemen is estimated to have been 377,000 at the end of 2021, according to a report from the UN's Development Programme. The majority of the deaths are among children under the age of five, the report says, with one child dying every nine minutes according to the UNDP. The war, which is in its seventh year, has seen some 80 percent of the population, or 24 million people, relying on aid and assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need. With Yemen importing more than 35% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, the disruption to wheat supplies will cause soaring increases in the price of food. UN officials say the truce could be easily extended. The UN started with a ceasefire meant for just the month of Ramadan, but the Houthis were resisting when it didn't include any easing of the naval blockade. Exact terms aren't public yet, but the UN press release states that the blockade will indeed be eased some. Fuel shipments to Hudaydah ports will be permitted, and certain flights in and out of Sana'a will also be allowed. The two sides are also discussing a prisoner swap under which hundreds from both sides would be freed. Ceasefires don't always hold as hoped, but if this one does, it could be the start of a proper peace process. Credit: this background is adapted from this article here and this article here. Will the ceasefire in Yemen hold for its intended duration? This question will resolve positively if the UN-brokered ceasefire between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coaltion has stood for two months, beginning on midnight of April 2, 2022 (GMT+3) and ending on midnight of June 2, 2022 (GMT+3). The ceasefire will be deemed to have stood as long as no reliable sources report that the ceasefire is no longer in effect. This question will resolve negatively if the ceasefire breaks down before midnight of June 2, 2022 (GMT+3).",

    "question": "Will the ceasefire in Yemen hold for its intended duration?",
    "id": "M10568",
    "background": "On the evening that started this year's Ramadan, the UN announced a surprise breakthrough on the ceasefire in Yemen, which previously appeared unlikely. They now say both sides have agreed to a full two-month ceasefire, beginning the first full day of Ramadan. This will be the first nationwide truce in Yemen in years, a welcome respite for its war-weary population. The death toll of the war in Yemen is estimated to have been 377,000 at the end of 2021, according to a report from the UN's Development Programme. The majority of the deaths are among children under the age of five, the report says, with one child dying every nine minutes according to the UNDP. The war, which is in its seventh year, has seen some 80 percent of the population, or 24 million people, relying on aid and assistance, including 14.3 million who are in acute need. With Yemen importing more than 35% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, the disruption to wheat supplies will cause soaring increases in the price of food. UN officials say the truce could be easily extended. The UN started with a ceasefire meant for just the month of Ramadan, but the Houthis were resisting when it didn't include any easing of the naval blockade. Exact terms aren't public yet, but the UN press release states that the blockade will indeed be eased some. Fuel shipments to Hudaydah ports will be permitted, and certain flights in and out of Sana'a will also be allowed. The two sides are also discussing a prisoner swap under which hundreds from both sides would be freed. Ceasefires don't always hold as hoped, but if this one does, it could be the start of a proper peace process. Credit: this background is adapted from this article here and this article here. Will the ceasefire in Yemen hold for its intended duration? This question will resolve positively if the UN-brokered ceasefire between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coaltion has stood for two months, beginning on midnight of April 2, 2022 (GMT+3) and ending on midnight of June 2, 2022 (GMT+3). The ceasefire will be deemed to have stood as long as no reliable sources report that the ceasefire is no longer in effect. This question will resolve negatively if the ceasefire breaks down before midnight of June 2, 2022 (GMT+3).",

    "id": "M10616",
    "background": "From Quartz, For much of the pandemic, China saw its zero-covid strategy as proof of its political system’s superiority in dealing with the virus. But Shanghai’s struggles show Beijing is now clinging to a strategy whose costs and dangers are mounting. In previous waves of covid, the strategy of mass testing and quarantining positive cases, along with partial lockdowns and border measures, was able to outpace the spread of the virus. But the highly transmissible nature of the omicron variant and its subtypes means it’s moving faster than China’s tried-and-tested methods to control it. Despite the financial hub’s two-stage lockdown—now extended indefinitely—China’s covid cases shot up from double digits in early March to over 20,000 on Tuesday (April 5). Nevertheless, the consensus seems to be that China won’t relax its prevention tactics until 2023, because of a key political event that will take place in October or November. At this year’s Communist Party Congress, which takes place every five years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is expected to announce his third term. Until it’s over, the whole system is even more geared than usual to maintaining stability and to avoiding a potential embarrassment to the party. Will China abandon their zero-covid strategy before June 1, 2022? China is said to have abandoned their zero-covid strategy before June 1st 2022 if ANY of the following things become true, A member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party makes a clear public statement announcing that the central government is abandoning their policy of zero-covid, and this statement is not censured or retracted within 24 hours. Articles from both the Associated Press and Reuters unambiguously state that the government of China is in the process of abandoning their zero-covid strategy. A generic person who tests positive in China for COVID-19 is no longer legally required to self-isolate for any amount of time, after testing positive. There is at least one city in mainland China with a population of more than one million people (by metro area) which recorded at least 10,000 COVID-19 cases in the past 7 days, and is not currently imposing any lockdown over a significant fraction (>2%) of its residents. A lockdown is defined as any policy of major restrictions on ordinary travel, or restrictions on social gatherings.

Heard had described herself \"seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.\"[5][6] [Short Fuse] How much money will be awarded to Johnny Depp in his defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard?
